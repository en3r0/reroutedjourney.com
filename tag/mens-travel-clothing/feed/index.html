While looking around, one brand stood above all others. ExOfficio. There is no shortage of travelers singing the praises of this brand, so I took the leap and ordered a pair from their website for 20 bucks.<span id="more-119"></span> Pretty steep, but I later found you can find them decently discounted elsewhere. Besides, if you are wearing them everyday, or every other day, then this price really isn&#8217;t so bad.</p>
<p>This was the first real purchase for our trip to India for me, so I was actually rather excited to get this holy grail of undies in the mail. As soon as they came I threw them on and they felt good. They were meant for my body. These things are made of 94% Nylon / 6% Lycra Spandex and treated with Aegis Microbe Shield. This stuff will wick away moisture and keep from smelling. These things should be the standard for men everywhere.</p>

Then they go back on in the morning. I am excited. I&#8217;ve ordered one more pair for a total of 2 pairs. Tiffany plans on having 3-4 pairs, but for me 2 will be plenty. <a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/i-never-dreamt-of-wearing-one-pair-of-underwear-for-a-year-or-two/">Be sure to check out Tiffany&#8217;s Review.</a></p>
<p>It is no wonder ExOfficio has gained the respect of so many travelers, this is an essential everyday item (for most people) and it is done right.</p>
