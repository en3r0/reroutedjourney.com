<p>Last night we wanted to go out but were tired of the same old places in town. (You know the drill, you ask &#8220;Where do you want to eat?&#8221; and Dustin replies &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Nothing sounds good. Where do YOU want to eat?&#8221;) We love Cheddars and Olive Garden but wanted a smaller restaurant in an area we hadn&#8217;t been before. I jumped online and began looking up places in Wooster, Ohio. I had seen signs for a place called The Barn and had remembered a friend say that there were a lot of shops in the area. Wooster is about thirty minutes from our house and is a college town. We never really hear of people hanging out in Wooster, but I thought there may be some gems to discover!  I was shocked at the amount of restaurants serving up quality food that resembled Chicago fare. I mentioned a few places to Dustin and we headed East.</p>
<p>Wooster is beautiful. There is so much architecture and lots of restored places. We found some free parking and felt like we were downtown Chicago in Lakeview or near Lincoln Park. Tons of other couples dressed up were walking around arm in arm.</p>
<p>We began out evening at <a href="http://www.citysquaresteakhouse.com/">The City Square Steakhouse</a>. As soon as we walked in we gave each other &#8220;the look&#8221; which said &#8220;this place is legit!&#8221; Beautiful exposed brick walls were highlighted with spotlights and photography. High back booths lined the corner and tables with white cloths filled the floor. When you walk in, you walk into the bar area which is stunning as well. Situated in an old building, the Steakhouse has different rooms. Behind the bar area is a room with a fireplace and library shelves. Further into the intimate space is a patio and dining space opening up to it. Our host led us to a quaint table right near the window for two. We grabbed the menus and dug in!</p>
<p><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-9.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-975" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-9.jpg" alt="unnamed-9" width="300" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The menu at the <a href="http://www.citysquaresteakhouse.com/" target="_blank">City Square Steakhouse</a> is&#8230;pricey. I had looked the place up before and knew that burgers were about $10-12. When we sat down in the dining room we weren&#8217;t brought a menu with them. Instead, the cheapest entree was about $20. Cringing I asked if they offered burgers in the dining area or if we needed to go to the bar. Our waiter didn&#8217;t hesitate and brought us the burger menu. We were on our way to delicious (more affordable) food. The regular menu was so delicious looking that we ordered an appetizer. The Housemade Chips with Roasted Red Pepper Blue Cheese Dip was $6.75. When it came to the table, we smiled even bigger! This is an appetizer worth splurging on! The chips were crispy and warm. Dipping them into the cheese just took it over the top. We were also offered fresh bread with butter.</p>
<div id="attachment_980" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-8.jpg"><img class="wp-image-980" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-8.jpg" alt="unnamed-8" width="300" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Luxe dining room at the steakhouse</p></div>
<div id="attachment_976" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-10.jpg"><img class="wp-image-976" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-10.jpg" alt="unnamed-10" width="300" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">House chips!</p></div>
<p>Our meals came quickly. I got the <a href="http://www.citysquaresteakhouse.com/burgers-sandwiches/" target="_blank">Mushroom Swiss Burger</a> with garlic mashed potatoes ($11.50) and Dustin went for the Blue Cheese Burger with fries ($10.75). The burgers were done to order and were extra big. The Mushroom Burger came with mushrooms, swiss cheese and rosemary mustard. The Blue Cheese Burger came with grilled onions, blue cheese and mayonnaise. We only ate 1/2 and had them package the rest up to go. Flavors upon flavors and attention to detail impressed our socks off. Our waiter was super friendly and classy without being too intimidating. Although we dined on burgers in a restaurant that served $60 steaks we felt our business and presence was appreciated. This made us want to come back! Although we&#8217;re not big steak people, my dad and sister are and would probably order a more expensive entree. We can&#8217;t wait to bring them and share this special discovery!</p>
<div id="attachment_982" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-21.jpg"><img class="wp-image-982" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-21.jpg" alt="unnamed-2" width="400" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dessert</p></div>
<div id="attachment_981" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-41.jpg"><img class="wp-image-981" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-41.jpg" alt="unnamed-4" width="300" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Imperial Gatsby</p></div>
<p>After dining at the steakhouse, we went to find a wine bar I found online. It was sadly closed so we walked around and headed to <a href="http://www.oakgroveeatery.com/" target="_blank">Oak Grove Eatery</a>. This eatery just re-opened in the Spring of 2014! They&#8217;re known for their freshly made food with a focus on local ingredients. Their coffee is made by their sister company,<a href="http://www.oakgrovecoffeeco.com/" target="_blank"> Oak Grove Coffee Co.</a> and it&#8217;s organic and fair trade. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, you really can&#8217;t go wrong with this place! The eatery was packed around 7pm so we sat at the bar. The interior is the perfect blend of modern and rustic. Ceramic pitchers refill your water and you can see into the kitchen in the back. High top tables, low tables and booths create different seating options and everyone from older couples to young families were eating. Our bartender was hip, friendly and fun. She didn&#8217;t hover over us but gave us plenty of attention and suggestions. We began ordering a port wine and a cocktail. Later, we ended up adding a dessert. I had the <a href="http://www.wine.com/v6/Emilio-Lustau-Deluxe-Cream-Capataz-Andres/wine/12845/Detail.aspx?state=OH" target="_blank">Emilio Lustau Deluxe Cream Sherry </a>dessert wine. Wow! Did it pack a flavor punch. It was rich and had nutty undertones. Dustin ordered the Imperial Gatsby. This drink had a sugar cube and an orange peel. I really can&#8217;t recall what else was in it. It was good but not as sweet as I would like.</p>
<div id="attachment_977" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-31.jpg"><img class="wp-image-977" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-31.jpg" alt="unnamed-3" width="300" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bar at the City Square Steakhouse</p></div>
<p>After drinks we ordered a sundae with homemade chocolate fudge, a brownie and coffee. It was delicious. It went perfectly with the port wine. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of ice cream but this was perfectly blended and creamy. After the $25 bill for dessert and drinks, we laughed but enjoyed our stay visiting and telling stories as it rained lightly outside.</p>
<div id="attachment_978" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-5.jpg"><img class="wp-image-978" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-5.jpg" alt="unnamed-5" width="300" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Inside Oak Grove</p></div>
<p>After the <a href="http://www.oakgroveeatery.com/" target="_blank">Oak Grove Eatery </a>we walked around downtown Wooster. We discovered a cool old bookstore (I looked it up and it&#8217;s called the <a href="http://www.woosterbook.com/page2/page2.html" target="_blank">Wooster Book Company</a>) that had all types of old and rare books. It was open until 9:00pm so we wandered the shelves and explored the upstairs. Although it was a great bookstore, I gawked at the price of books ($5-9) and didn&#8217;t look for any to take home. Other things we saw were: a coffee shop, art store, bakery and other restaurants.</p>
<div id="attachment_979" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-7.jpg"><img class="wp-image-979 size-full" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-7.jpg" alt="unnamed-7" width="361" height="481" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Across the street from City Square Steakhouse, Oak Grove Eatery</p></div>
<p>We look forward to visiting again and checking out Broken Rocks Cafe &amp; Bakery, Muddy Waters Cafe &amp; Grill, First Amendment Public House, Spoon Market, and Tulipan Hungarian Pastry &amp; Coffee Shop.</p>
<p>We splurged a little bit. Here&#8217;s the breakdown.</p>
<p>Appetizer, 2 burgers &amp; water at The City Square Steakhouse $30 ($36 with tip)</p>
<p>1 Glass of wine, 1 cocktail &amp; shared dessert at Oak Grove Eatery $25 ($30 with tip)</p>
<p>Total: $66</p>
<p><strong>Travel/date night tip</strong>: Get quality H20 at dinner and skip dessert. This way you can spread the night out and enjoy two separate places. You could also make this date cheaper by skipping the appetizer altogether and just ordering 2 burgers. We also tend to order an entree and appetizer and share both instead of 2 entrees. If you want to do drinks/dessert cheaper buy a cake mix and bottle of wine and have a &#8220;baking night&#8221;</p>

<p>After looking online, I decided we should check out Cleveland. We&#8217;ve been to Columbus and Cincinnati since moving back to Ohio and haven&#8217;t spent a lot of time exploring up north. I was hesitant about downtown hotels and was curious about the walkability of the city. After spending a lot of time looking at hotels I decided I wanted to stay at the <a href="http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/ohio/the-tudor-arms-hotel-cleveland-a-doubletree-by-hilton-CLEUCDT/index.html" target="_blank">Tudor Arms Hotel by DoubleTree</a>. After looking more, I realized it wasn&#8217;t in a very walkable area and we&#8217;d have to drive around too much. I&#8217;d still love to stay there, but since it&#8217;s so close to the Cleveland Clinic, I&#8217;m not sure if they run many specials. We also looked at the <a href="http://www.gliddenhouse.com/" target="_blank">Glidden House</a> which is a B &amp; B near the museum campus.</p>
<div id="attachment_946" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-20.jpg"><img class="wp-image-946" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-20.jpg" alt="unnamed-20" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Inside the theater</p></div>
<p>In the end, we settled on the <a href="http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/ohio/cleveland/wyndham-cleveland-at-playhousesquare/hotel-overview" target="_blank">Wyndham</a> downtown at <a href="http://www.playhousesquare.org/" target="_blank">Playhouse Square</a>. The Wyndham had packages that made the stay much more affordable. We purchased the Rock and Roll Package which included valet service for 24 hours, two tickets to the <a href="http://www.rockhall.com/" target="_blank">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, the room and a gourmet breakfast buffet in the morning. The total was $205 without tax. Parking would&#8217;ve been $20 minimum and tickets to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame were $25 each. The breakfast was about $13 per person. With the package, the savings made the hotel room only $109!</p>
<div id="attachment_947" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-19.jpg"><img class="wp-image-947" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-19.jpg" alt="unnamed-19" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Outside the theater</p></div>

<div id="attachment_957" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-27.jpg"><img class="wp-image-957" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-27.jpg" alt="unnamed-27" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The ceiling above the balcony</p></div>
<p>Playhouse Square is the theater district of Cleveland. The Wyndham is located right on the square and you can see both the chandelier and the playhouse sign from the front door. Our room was on the fourteenth floor and we had a great view of the Playhouse Square sign which was lit up at night. The theaters were within seconds of the entrance and there were also many restaurants and bars. As soon as we checked into our room we fell asleep on the massive king bed. Once we awoke we got ready to see Casablanca at the <a href="http://www.playhousesquare.org/venues/detail/palace-theatre" target="_blank">Connor Palace Theater</a>. Before entering the theater we made a stop at Starbucks and ordered an Iced Caramel Macchiato.</p>
<p>After we reserved our hotel I looked up performances to see. For only $5 I found that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)" target="_blank">Casablanca</a> was showing at the Palace Theater. I was really excited since Dustin and I once watched parts of it on a cruise ship under the stars and remember that moment fondly. (So romantic) For $10, how couldn&#8217;t you go see it? What we weren&#8217;t expecting was the beauty of the theater. The Connor Palace has been restored beautifully. We felt as if we had stepped back in time when we walked in the doors. The crowd was a wonderful mix of families, singles and couples. Some were dressed up, others weren&#8217;t. There was popcorn served in traditional boxes and a bar open. We grabbed a box of popcorn and made our way up into the balcony. The architecture was honestly so amazing. As we found out seats we listened to a live orchestra. About 400 others filled with space. Before the black and white movie began, there were cartoons played. The room filled with laughter and cheering. It was a magical experience. The movie proved to be excellent. I can&#8217;t think of a shared experience from the last year I&#8217;ve cherished more with Dustin &#8211; crunching on popcorn while watching one of the best movies in the world.</p>

<p>After the movie we were really hungry. We took out the car and headed to Ohio City for the best pizza in Ohio! <a href="http://barcento.com/" target="_blank">Bar Cento</a> is a happening spot and was filled since the Gay Games were happening. We ordered a large fry which we could only finish 1/2 of! In addition to the fry we ordered a pizza to share. (Gone before I had a chance to take a picture) The restaurant is laid back but really buzzing. There is a huge bar space in the back with couches and even a pool table. There were a lot of people there even at midnight.</p>
<p>Dustin wanted something sweet so we hit up <a href="http://mitchellshomemade.com/" target="_blank">Mitchell&#8217;s Ice Cream</a>. We shared a tasting duo and got Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup and Caramel Fudge Brownie. It was some of the best ice cream I&#8217;ve ever had and the shop is open really late! After eating and exploring more, we made our way back to the hotel where we chilled and watched cable (a luxury since we don&#8217;t have it at home). The next morning we got to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!</p>
<p>$10 Movie at Connor Palace, $5 Popcorn, $5 Starbucks shared, $4 Ice Cream, $1 Parking, $25 dinner at Bar Cento = $50 Date Out</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Valentine’s Day was extra special this year.<b><b> </b></b></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Our good friend Lindsey decided to get tattooed with us by Ali McGregor from <a href="http://www.capcitytattooco.com/" target="_blank">Cap City Tattoo</a>. Lindsey was inked with a beautiful tribute to our good friend Jon Pound who passed away two years ago from cancer. He had always dreamed of going to India and loved books about Ghandi and Mother Teresa. He had the word “Hope” in Hindi tattooed above his chemotherapy port. A lot of our friends and his family members have gotten the same tattoo as a tribute to him and his calling. Lindsey helped design the lettering and had the tattoo done above her heart. A group of friends and us came to support her. Chris, surprised everyone by taking off her sweatshirt to reveal a t-shirt with Jon’s face on it! We all laughed and cried a little as we remembered our good friend. Among all who were there was: Spencer, Chris and Kenzie, Lindsey and Dustin and I.</p>

<h2>My Vintage Frame</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Inspired by a white-board, and empty frame&#8230;I got an antique frame with the word “empathy” tattooed on my left wrist. God is constantly bringing people to my mind to pray for and I am always scribbling with sharpies (I have the 80’s inspired set) on my arm. Now that I have a blank frame, I can place people’s names or other types of words and concepts to meditate on, on my wrist. I’ve already had many names, quotes, and Bible verses written in my perfect frame. This tattoo was extremely painful and probably the worst one I’ve gotten. The traditional banner hits my wrist bone on both sides and the nerve endings hurt like crazy. I braved it out though and Alli, our artist, even called me her “brave little soldier.” (for the record, I didn’t cry!)</p>
<h2> The Compass</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Dustin continued to work on his “nautical themed arm” and got a beautiful compass on his forearm. I think it’s really awesome and it flows really well with the shape of his arm. He said it didn’t hurt at all and really enjoyed getting it done. His next tattoo will probably be of a gigantic ship as soon as we have the money to invest.</p>
<h2> Our Date</h2>
<p dir="ltr">After grabbing a delicious lunch of butternut squash soup and chicken salad on a croissant from What’s For Dessert, we headed to C-bus with coffee in tow. We listened to great music and we were excited to hang out with our friends at the tattoo studio. Once there we all took turns running over to the coffee house across the street in the historic district of Columbus and grabbed lattes and Cliff bars. After eight hours there, Dustin and I were ready to eat. We drove to Easton Town Center and I got to go to my all time favorite store: <a href="http://www.lushusa.com/" target="_blank">LUSH Cosmetics</a>. (More on them later). I purchased some bath bombs and natural deodorant and then we were seated at <a href="http://www.pfchangs.com/index.aspx" target="_blank">P.F. Changs</a> for a late dinner. Our waiter noticed the familiar black-trash-bag-like wraps on our arms and asked about our tattoos. We decided to have a go at the Prixe Fix Menu which included two entrees, an appetizer, two soups, and two desserts. We devoured the lettuce wraps and sipped the soup. We ordered sweet and sour chicken and a spicy chicken dish and shared, reaching over each other’s plates. After eating so much, we asked for our dessert to go and after getting home and taking a bubble bath with my new bath bomb I layed in the bed and ate my tiramisu! Honestly, this Valentine’s Day was one of the BEST and I was so excited to spend time with the love of my life and some of our dearest friends. So many people forget to celebrate love and relationships everyday and it was a great time to step back and reflect on how fortunate we are to have each other and other amazing humans in our lives.</p>
