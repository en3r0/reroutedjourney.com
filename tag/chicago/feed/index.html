				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Living at <a href="http://resideliving.com/community-detail.cfm?Community=The-Belmont-by-Reside" target="_blank">The Belmont</a> in Lakeview was an absolute blast. While I worked in Chicago my husband Dustin and I lived in a studio on the water. There were awesome concierge&#8217;s (Shout out to Ibraham, Marcus, &amp; John) and amazing views of Belmont Harbor. It was an absolute blast living on the tenth floor and in our first year of marriage we even adopted a little kitten named City.</p>

<p>The rooftop had a great herb garden that you could pick herbs from for cooking and two large grills with seating. Surround sound on the rooftop was fun because you could play DJ and plug in your Ipod. We really enjoyed watching movies up there and enjoyed the massive fire pit too! In the warm weather we would always grill out or bring a glass of wine up there to enjoy the view and the sail boats on the harbor.</p>
<div id="attachment_242" style="width: 491px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-242 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/30325_468777373288_678288288_6111320_7814528_n.jpg" alt="Revolving Door at The Belmont" width="481" height="720" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Revolving Door</p></div>

<p>From the rooftop you could see the Sears tower and the Lake since we were right off Lakeshore Drive. There was a club room that offered a full sized kitchen, flat screens, light dimmers, and a pool table. We also would use the state of the art gym on the penthouse floor. In the lobby there was an art gallery and the community would welcome a new artist every month complete with a reception. Appetizers and wine were often offered and you could mingle with the neighbors at several parties a year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my favorite things The Belmont did was offer a coffee shop in the lobby. For 75 cents you could grab a Krups tea or coffee on your way to work. I was always fishing in my purse for quarters before missing the bus for our morning commute. Dustin and I would actually ride the CTA to work together and then I would take another bus or subway to get to the South Side. Dustin worked right down town above Union Station on the twentieth floor for Option Monster Holdings Inc. I worked as the Community Relations Specialist for the University of Chicago Medical Center.</p>
<div id="attachment_248" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-248 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/60997_10150106283143289_678288288_7345780_3767811_n.jpg" alt="Eating On The Belmont Rooftop Looking Toward Downtown Chicago" width="720" height="482" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pasta on the Rooftop</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_249" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-249 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/60607_10150106283233289_678288288_7345784_2074334_n.jpg" alt="Looking at Belmont Harbor From The Belmont Rooftop" width="720" height="482" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Belmont Harbor</p></div>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-250" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/62813_10150106283313289_678288288_7345787_5055183_n.jpg" alt="Belmont Harbor and Lake Michigan" width="720" height="482" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that we were within walking distance of EVERYTHING and our walking score was 98. Over 300 food places delivered to our room and we had an attached dry cleaners, salon, and convenient store where we would grab Tylenol and an occasional munchie. It&#8217;s kind of crazy to think that when we lived here we were only 21 and 23. I had just turned 21 before we moved in and on more than one occasion someone thought Dustin was a delivery bod instead of a resident.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-251" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/30325_468777543288_678288288_6111332_6487983_n.jpg" alt="Ceiling Inside The Belmont" width="720" height="481" /></p>

<div id="attachment_253" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-253 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/30325_468777513288_678288288_6111329_884927_n.jpg" alt="More of the The Belmont Lobby" width="720" height="481" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lobby &amp; Elevators</p></div>
<p>In the evenings The Belmont would play old silent black and white movies on the flat screens in the lobby. I remember sitting by the fire and listening to the classic music play softly. It felt quite similar to a 20&#8217;s hotel. After speaking with a resident that had lived there for many years she shared that there was once a grand baby piano in the lobby. The indoor parking garage used to be a huge ballroom. Our studio, which was less than 500 square feet was $1000.00 a month with included utilities. Although it was tiny, the ceilings were huge and the view spectacular. We really loved the Belmont and later needed a bigger place so moved to Lincoln Square; a smaller neighborhood further north of Chicago off the Western brown line.</p>
<div id="attachment_240" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-240 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/30325_468777618288_678288288_6111336_7511072_n.jpg" alt="Outside of The Belmont Building" width="720" height="481" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Outside of The Belmont</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the above amenities, The Belmont offered valet parking for $200 a month and had an awesome business room with computers, a copy machine, and a huge meeting room. Last but not least one of my favorite parts of living there was the beautiful letter shoot that went up to the Penthouse-you would drop a letter from the tenth floor and it would fall into the ornate gold box on the first floor. I thought many mornings about how many old letters had gotten caught in there-since it had been around since the 1800s.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Khara Ledonne switches from painting huge scale murals to teeny tiny lockets. I first fell in love with her whimsical lockets about the size of a traditional marble in Lincoln Square in Chicago at a small art store called <a href="http://www.sacredartstore.com/">Sacred Art</a>. One of my friends Lisa is the Curator there. I gasped and opened all of the tiny lockets revealing some of the coolest illustrations I’ve seen in awhile. Of course I begged Dustin for one because 1. it was creative jewelry 2. she hand paints the cute lockets! Somehow the beautiful lockets didn’t shake from my memory in December and I casually mentioned one as a Christmas list wish. To my surprise Dustin tracked the locket down and had one custom ordered for me with a kite painted inside.</p>
<p>It is so beautiful and I couldn’t help but research the artist and post about it here! Not only is the locket beautiful, it comes in a very cute altoid-like box (mine had birds on it) to keep it safe in. Khara has done some amazing works both tiny and large. She said “Enormous, created worlds, and teeny, created worlds are endlessly engaging for me.  Someday I’ll build a house and really go nuts.” on her website. What an artist after my own heart! Check her out <a href="http://kharaledonne.com/">here</a> and on etsy <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/kharaledonne">here</a> to purchase her lockets. You won’t regret it!</p>

<div id="attachment_130" style="width: 269px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/minow/5674130665/"><img class="size-full wp-image-130  " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/images1.jpeg" alt="Tea and Muffin at Argo Tea" width="259" height="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Enjoying Tea &amp; a Muffin photo by cranberries</p></div>
<p>Argo Tea is the new “Starbucks” of tea and Chicagoans know it. Advancing to Boston, New York, and St. Louis, this tea shop knows tea! With the zen-like green logo and enticing glass tea pots this tea shop located in numerous places around Chicago including Lakeview, the Loop and Streeterville, is a new hang out for tea and coffee goers alike.Argo is “passionate about bringing teas directly from growers around the world and blending them into unique and delicious beverages and teas.” With the mantra “one customer and one cup at a time,” Argo treats every customer who walks through their door as an old friend. If you’re lucky to live near one of these tea heavens you’ll soon get to know your tea Batistas and they’ll remember your order accordingly. Another plus at Argo is the free samples. Not sure if you’re a white or green tea guy/gal? Ask to sample a few blends and with the help of the Argo expert behind the counter you’ll be on your way to becoming a tea</p>
<div id="attachment_129" style="width: 204px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vectorlyme/2585741787/"><img class="size-full wp-image-129 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/images-1.jpeg" alt="Argo Tea on Broadway" width="194" height="259" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Broadway Argo Tea photo by vectorlyme</p></div>
<p>connoisseur.Argo tea offers extremely unique blends such as the Mojitea, a non-alcoholic tea twist on the traditional Mojito and different tea smoothies. (I really love their raspberry tea smoothie and the tea sangria.) Diversity, creativity, charity, sustainability, and community are all values the company holds to.</p>
<p>My all-time favorite Argo Tea is on Broadway and has many couches and an upstairs loft to work and people watch. I’ve spent quite a few snowy days up there drinking a delicious Chai and watching the snowy Chicago CTA pass by. Argo is also perfect in the summer for grabbing an iced tea and sitting out on their patio. Dogs are welcome to join outside and water is usually provided for them. Wifi is free to use and most of the tables are outfitted with outlets for long use.</p>
<p>Another great aspect of Argo are their bottled teas to go and their tea-infused “snack pots.” My favorite snack pot was the turkey with black beans, mangoes, and brown rice. You can purchase loose leaf teas at the shop and create your own blends. Another great item to buy at the shop are their glass tea tumblers which are extremely cute and reasonably priced.</p>
<div id="attachment_131" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-131  " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/253676_10150336091063289_678288288_9937132_4944527_n-300x225.jpg" alt="Enjoying Argo Tea" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Me Enjoying My Argo</p></div>
<p>If you’re lucky to stumble upon one of the live performances at Argo you’ll be amazed at how cozy and friendly the atmosphere is. In January of last year the Chicago Blizzard of 2011 kept most people from work and left us to work from home. After fighting the cold and trudging up to Argo there was a free acoustic show playing and tons of artists visiting. Next time you’re in the neighborhood make sure to check out Argo and order the Vanilla Chai with Soy milk for no extra charge!</p>

<div id="attachment_24" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-24   " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/4461429858_2455fe0d15-225x300.jpg" alt="Intelligentsia Coffee" width="225" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">photo by Keith Chu</p></div>
<p>If you ever find yourself wandering around north Broadway Avenue in Chicago you may stop in your tracks as hypnotic fumes fill your lungs. You may also grab the arm of the nearest person around you and ask with urgency what this smell could possible be in all of the earth and how you can acquire more.</p>
<p>This situation, my friends, occurs on a daily basis in front of the world known Intelligentsia Coffee shop and happened to me when I first stumbled upon the coffee house which happened to be less than a block from my studio. In the up and coming neighborhood of Lakeview you can find a cult-following of the coffee and their splendid teas. With partnerships with bands like Chicago-based Wilco and their own roasters, Intelligentsia has become one of the world’s leading independent coffee shops in the United States.</p>
<p>On arriving in the small but airy shop you will be immediately greeted by the sound of espresso machines whistling and the latest independent music. One glance around and you will come to the realization that this coffee shop is different than any other you’ve been in. A balance of earthy wood elements and industrial accents enhance the espresso machines and french presser&#8217;s on display. The cleverly designed logo; wings with a cup of coffee in the middle below a red star, will adorn ceramic mugs, tea cups and saucers alike. Before you capture the entire seen a tattooed Barista will greet you warmly and offer the days featured brews and teas. If you aren’t dedicated to a specific drink this is the time to ask for a recommendation as Michael Phillips, a previous Barista took first place in the 2010 World Barista Championships.</p>
<p>Although the shop’s claim to fame remains their delectable bean brews you can find that their tea is just as tantalizing. With over twenty teas (fifteen organic) on the menu, one can choose a blend that fits their taste. Organic Moroccan Mint seizes the drinker with jasmine and basket fired green tea. My all time favorite remains the Organic Earl Grey tea which boasts floral citrus flavors perfect to begin a cold, winter day in Chicago. Organic Jasmine Peach, Summer Satrupa Assam, and Organic Crane Blue Blend also offer the drinker much discovery, enticing the pallet.</p>

<p>According to Intelligentsia&#8217;s website, tea drinking is “an ephemeral art form to be relished with all the senses.” By cupping teas that prove exceptional to the tasters, the company offers only the very best and intriguing teas to its customers. In addition to leading in the tea industry, Intelligentsia offers sustainable and direct trade teas making them my favorite tea provider in all of the Windy City.</p>
