<p>After confirming our plane tickets to New Delhi, India it occurred to me that:</p>
<p>1. We were truly leaving to travel the world.<br />
2. Dustin was frowning about checking luggage as it can be an extra $100 per person.<br />
3. I would need to pack all of my belongings in my carry on backpack.<span id="more-438"></span></p>
<p><strong>The first point didn’t cause me much panic.</strong> We’ve been free spirits since the day we met and have moved an average of once every six months since being married.</p>
<p><strong>The second point made sense.</strong> Why would we check luggage that we didn’t need and pay hundreds of dollars? We could easily carry on our packs and more than 35 liters wasn&#8217;t realistic to lug around India anyways. (If you haven’t met Dustin or I, take my word that we aren’t necessarily “athletic” in any sense of the word.)</p>
<p><strong>The third point left me uneasy.</strong> The third point brought to life every idea I’d ever had about travelling the world with only the “clothes on my back.” I do really like clothes, makeup and well, anything to improve my personal hygiene. Packing everything I would need to travel in one backpack caused me to sit quietly and go through my favorite clothing and mentally “pack.” A 35 liter backpack couldn’t be enough, could it? Whether it is or isn’t enough for all of my prized possessions, it’s all I’m bringing on the plane July 16th to leave the U.S. Here’s the list of clothing that Dustin and I decided upon for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 T-shirts</li>
<li>1 pair of lightweight travel cargo pants</li>
<li>1 travel skirt</li>
<li>2 pairs of socks</li>
<li>2 layering tank tops</li>
<li>1 long-sleeved top</li>
<li>1 jacket</li>
<li>2 bras</li>
<li>3-4 pairs of underwear (I insisted on more than 2)</li>
<li>1 bathing suit</li>
<li>1 cardigan (ok, I just added this while typing this post)</li>
<li>1 pair of sandals</li>
<li>1 pair of trainers</li>
</ul>
<p>20 items of clothing. It seems sparse when thinking about it. When typing it out I feel rich. I guess based on the fact that most people in the world live on one (two if lucky) changes of clothing, it makes me realize I can do this.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while I research and gather the best gear out there to last more than a year (that is, without being stolen), I’ll be posting and reviewing my top picks and links to where you can find and purchase them online. (<a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/i-never-dreamt-of-wearing-one-pair-of-underwear-for-a-year-or-two/">Beginning with the best travel undies ever!</a>) To be honest in a way the idea of only carrying the clothes I own on my back is freeing. Two words I leave you with: less laundry!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-380" title="Exofficio Womens Underwear Packed" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/exofficio_womens_underwear_packed-616x1024.jpg" alt="Exofficio Womens Underwear Packed" width="222" height="368" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/exofficio_womens_underwear_packed-616x1024.jpg 616w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/exofficio_womens_underwear_packed.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px" />But, ExOfficio had it in mind before I had ever heard of travel underwear or their kick butt brand of world travel clothing. Now let me be clear, I like my underwear just as you do clean and comfortable but if there’s a way to travel with less and still get those qualities sign me up. After many weeks researching for the very best in travel clothing I was introduced to ExOfficio Give-N-Go Underwear. These underwear are a literal God-send for those like us who plan on traveling to remote places with only our pack on our backs.</p>
<p>The Give-N-Go underwear are uber quick drying, highly breathable, tagless, treated with Aegis Microbe Shield (to prevent stank), and have a low-profile ⅝” waist line. They aren’t ugly which is a plus so you don’t feel like you’re wearing your great grandma’s high waisted skin tone nasties and they come in many styles such as boy cut, low rise, and even thongs. I’ll admit I was skeptical at first but after receiving them in the mail and trying them on I was hooked. For about $20 you can purchase a pair that will last forever (at least two years) and will make your pack light. The tag line for these personables is “17 Countries. 6 Weeks. One Pair of underwear. (OK maybe two.)”</p>
<p>Upon trying on the underwear I was surprised at how lightweight they were. If I hadn’t known better I would’ve thought I was going commando. The weight (or lack of) is excellent and the best part is the moisture wicking capability. Knowing that I’ll be in 100 plus degree heat and sitting for long periods of time was giving me a mild anxiety attack. I’ll be the first to admit that  things get rather clammy down there and these underwear keep it fresh. In addition to wicking away moisture from your body, the Give-N-Go’s can be washed in a hostel sink or by a river and dry within a few hours.</p>
<p>Ordering two pairs was doable after I tried on the underwear and wore them but I decided on ordering a few extras for India. (The bikini-style wine colored ones were too cute). In addition to offering undies ExOfficio also offers coordinating lace camisoles which add some sexy to this travel wear. I’ll be offering up some more reviews on these later.<a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/exofficio_womens_underwear_out.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-379" title="Exofficio Womens Underwear Out" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/exofficio_womens_underwear_out-300x197.jpg" alt="Exofficio Womens Underwear Out" width="300" height="197" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/exofficio_womens_underwear_out-300x197.jpg 300w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/exofficio_womens_underwear_out.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Dustin has been rocking the men’s briefs and I’ll admit that they’re pretty great. I think he’s on day eight and has been cleaning them in our sink to get a good feel of how they’ll hold up in India. <a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/travel-underwear-for-men/">Check out Dustin’s review here.</a></p>
<p>Concluding- these underwear are the best on the market. Almost any review I read led me straight to the ExOfficio brand. If the undies weren’t cool enough the packaging is awesome and the plastic pouch they come in can be reused for documents or to organize junk drawers. Like they say, keep your clothes close and your underwear closer.</p>

While looking around, one brand stood above all others. ExOfficio. There is no shortage of travelers singing the praises of this brand, so I took the leap and ordered a pair from their website for 20 bucks.<span id="more-119"></span> Pretty steep, but I later found you can find them decently discounted elsewhere. Besides, if you are wearing them everyday, or every other day, then this price really isn&#8217;t so bad.</p>
<p>This was the first real purchase for our trip to India for me, so I was actually rather excited to get this holy grail of undies in the mail. As soon as they came I threw them on and they felt good. They were meant for my body. These things are made of 94% Nylon / 6% Lycra Spandex and treated with Aegis Microbe Shield. This stuff will wick away moisture and keep from smelling. These things should be the standard for men everywhere.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-377 alignright" title="ExOfficio Mens Underwear Out" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/exofficio_mens_underwear_out-300x241.jpg" alt="ExOfficio Mens Underwear Out" width="300" height="241" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/exofficio_mens_underwear_out-300x241.jpg 300w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/exofficio_mens_underwear_out.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I have been going for a week straight now, washing at night and letting them dry. Then they go back on in the morning. I am excited. I&#8217;ve ordered one more pair for a total of 2 pairs. Tiffany plans on having 3-4 pairs, but for me 2 will be plenty. <a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/i-never-dreamt-of-wearing-one-pair-of-underwear-for-a-year-or-two/">Be sure to check out Tiffany&#8217;s Review.</a></p>
<p>It is no wonder ExOfficio has gained the respect of so many travelers, this is an essential everyday item (for most people) and it is done right.</p>
