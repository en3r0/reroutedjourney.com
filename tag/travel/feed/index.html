<p>Last night we wanted to go out but were tired of the same old places in town. (You know the drill, you ask &#8220;Where do you want to eat?&#8221; and Dustin replies &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Nothing sounds good. Where do YOU want to eat?&#8221;) We love Cheddars and Olive Garden but wanted a smaller restaurant in an area we hadn&#8217;t been before. I jumped online and began looking up places in Wooster, Ohio. I had seen signs for a place called The Barn and had remembered a friend say that there were a lot of shops in the area. Wooster is about thirty minutes from our house and is a college town. We never really hear of people hanging out in Wooster, but I thought there may be some gems to discover!  I was shocked at the amount of restaurants serving up quality food that resembled Chicago fare. I mentioned a few places to Dustin and we headed East.</p>
<p>Wooster is beautiful. There is so much architecture and lots of restored places. We found some free parking and felt like we were downtown Chicago in Lakeview or near Lincoln Park. Tons of other couples dressed up were walking around arm in arm.</p>
<p>We began out evening at <a href="http://www.citysquaresteakhouse.com/">The City Square Steakhouse</a>. As soon as we walked in we gave each other &#8220;the look&#8221; which said &#8220;this place is legit!&#8221; Beautiful exposed brick walls were highlighted with spotlights and photography. High back booths lined the corner and tables with white cloths filled the floor. When you walk in, you walk into the bar area which is stunning as well. Situated in an old building, the Steakhouse has different rooms. Behind the bar area is a room with a fireplace and library shelves. Further into the intimate space is a patio and dining space opening up to it. Our host led us to a quaint table right near the window for two. We grabbed the menus and dug in!</p>
<p><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-9.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-975" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-9.jpg" alt="unnamed-9" width="300" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The menu at the <a href="http://www.citysquaresteakhouse.com/" target="_blank">City Square Steakhouse</a> is&#8230;pricey. I had looked the place up before and knew that burgers were about $10-12. When we sat down in the dining room we weren&#8217;t brought a menu with them. Instead, the cheapest entree was about $20. Cringing I asked if they offered burgers in the dining area or if we needed to go to the bar. Our waiter didn&#8217;t hesitate and brought us the burger menu. We were on our way to delicious (more affordable) food. The regular menu was so delicious looking that we ordered an appetizer. The Housemade Chips with Roasted Red Pepper Blue Cheese Dip was $6.75. When it came to the table, we smiled even bigger! This is an appetizer worth splurging on! The chips were crispy and warm. Dipping them into the cheese just took it over the top. We were also offered fresh bread with butter.</p>
<div id="attachment_980" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-8.jpg"><img class="wp-image-980" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-8.jpg" alt="unnamed-8" width="300" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Luxe dining room at the steakhouse</p></div>
<div id="attachment_976" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-10.jpg"><img class="wp-image-976" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-10.jpg" alt="unnamed-10" width="300" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">House chips!</p></div>
<p>Our meals came quickly. I got the <a href="http://www.citysquaresteakhouse.com/burgers-sandwiches/" target="_blank">Mushroom Swiss Burger</a> with garlic mashed potatoes ($11.50) and Dustin went for the Blue Cheese Burger with fries ($10.75). The burgers were done to order and were extra big. The Mushroom Burger came with mushrooms, swiss cheese and rosemary mustard. The Blue Cheese Burger came with grilled onions, blue cheese and mayonnaise. We only ate 1/2 and had them package the rest up to go. Flavors upon flavors and attention to detail impressed our socks off. Our waiter was super friendly and classy without being too intimidating. Although we dined on burgers in a restaurant that served $60 steaks we felt our business and presence was appreciated. This made us want to come back! Although we&#8217;re not big steak people, my dad and sister are and would probably order a more expensive entree. We can&#8217;t wait to bring them and share this special discovery!</p>
<div id="attachment_982" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-21.jpg"><img class="wp-image-982" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-21.jpg" alt="unnamed-2" width="400" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dessert</p></div>
<div id="attachment_981" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-41.jpg"><img class="wp-image-981" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-41.jpg" alt="unnamed-4" width="300" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Imperial Gatsby</p></div>
<p>After dining at the steakhouse, we went to find a wine bar I found online. It was sadly closed so we walked around and headed to <a href="http://www.oakgroveeatery.com/" target="_blank">Oak Grove Eatery</a>. This eatery just re-opened in the Spring of 2014! They&#8217;re known for their freshly made food with a focus on local ingredients. Their coffee is made by their sister company,<a href="http://www.oakgrovecoffeeco.com/" target="_blank"> Oak Grove Coffee Co.</a> and it&#8217;s organic and fair trade. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, you really can&#8217;t go wrong with this place! The eatery was packed around 7pm so we sat at the bar. The interior is the perfect blend of modern and rustic. Ceramic pitchers refill your water and you can see into the kitchen in the back. High top tables, low tables and booths create different seating options and everyone from older couples to young families were eating. Our bartender was hip, friendly and fun. She didn&#8217;t hover over us but gave us plenty of attention and suggestions. We began ordering a port wine and a cocktail. Later, we ended up adding a dessert. I had the <a href="http://www.wine.com/v6/Emilio-Lustau-Deluxe-Cream-Capataz-Andres/wine/12845/Detail.aspx?state=OH" target="_blank">Emilio Lustau Deluxe Cream Sherry </a>dessert wine. Wow! Did it pack a flavor punch. It was rich and had nutty undertones. Dustin ordered the Imperial Gatsby. This drink had a sugar cube and an orange peel. I really can&#8217;t recall what else was in it. It was good but not as sweet as I would like.</p>
<div id="attachment_977" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-31.jpg"><img class="wp-image-977" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-31.jpg" alt="unnamed-3" width="300" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bar at the City Square Steakhouse</p></div>
<p>After drinks we ordered a sundae with homemade chocolate fudge, a brownie and coffee. It was delicious. It went perfectly with the port wine. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of ice cream but this was perfectly blended and creamy. After the $25 bill for dessert and drinks, we laughed but enjoyed our stay visiting and telling stories as it rained lightly outside.</p>
<div id="attachment_978" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-5.jpg"><img class="wp-image-978" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-5.jpg" alt="unnamed-5" width="300" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Inside Oak Grove</p></div>
<p>After the <a href="http://www.oakgroveeatery.com/" target="_blank">Oak Grove Eatery </a>we walked around downtown Wooster. We discovered a cool old bookstore (I looked it up and it&#8217;s called the <a href="http://www.woosterbook.com/page2/page2.html" target="_blank">Wooster Book Company</a>) that had all types of old and rare books. It was open until 9:00pm so we wandered the shelves and explored the upstairs. Although it was a great bookstore, I gawked at the price of books ($5-9) and didn&#8217;t look for any to take home. Other things we saw were: a coffee shop, art store, bakery and other restaurants.</p>
<div id="attachment_979" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-7.jpg"><img class="wp-image-979 size-full" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-7.jpg" alt="unnamed-7" width="361" height="481" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Across the street from City Square Steakhouse, Oak Grove Eatery</p></div>
<p>We look forward to visiting again and checking out Broken Rocks Cafe &amp; Bakery, Muddy Waters Cafe &amp; Grill, First Amendment Public House, Spoon Market, and Tulipan Hungarian Pastry &amp; Coffee Shop.</p>
<p>We splurged a little bit. Here&#8217;s the breakdown.</p>
<p>Appetizer, 2 burgers &amp; water at The City Square Steakhouse $30 ($36 with tip)</p>
<p>1 Glass of wine, 1 cocktail &amp; shared dessert at Oak Grove Eatery $25 ($30 with tip)</p>
<p>Total: $66</p>
<p><strong>Travel/date night tip</strong>: Get quality H20 at dinner and skip dessert. This way you can spread the night out and enjoy two separate places. You could also make this date cheaper by skipping the appetizer altogether and just ordering 2 burgers. We also tend to order an entree and appetizer and share both instead of 2 entrees. If you want to do drinks/dessert cheaper buy a cake mix and bottle of wine and have a &#8220;baking night&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_964" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_2185.jpg"><img class="wp-image-964" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_2185.jpg" alt="IMG_2185" width="400" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland</p></div>
<p>I realized that I never completely finished this travel series! A friend of mine mentioned it to me the other day and I logged on and realized I didn&#8217;t write about our time at The Rock n&#8217; Roll Hall of Fame.</p>
<div id="attachment_969" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-969" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1.jpg" alt="photo-1" width="400" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dustin exploring the museum</p></div>
<p>After staying the night in <a href="http://www.playhousesquare.org/" target="_blank">Playhouse Square</a> downtown Cleveland, we slept in a bit then went downstairs for a breakfast buffet. The buffet was included in our getaway package and was held at the <a href="http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/ohio/cleveland/wyndham-cleveland-at-playhousesquare/hotel-dining" target="_blank">Encore Restaurant</a>. As I mentioned earlier, <a href="http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/ohio/cleveland/wyndham-cleveland-at-playhousesquare/hotel-overview" target="_blank">The Wyndham</a> had packages that made the stay much more affordable. We purchased the Rock and Roll Package which included valet service for 24 hours, two tickets to the <a href="http://www.rockhall.com/" target="_blank">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, the room and a gourmet breakfast buffet in the morning. The total was $205 without tax. Parking would’ve been $20 minimum and tickets to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame were $25 each. The breakfast was about $13 per person. With the package, the savings made the hotel room only $109!</p>
<div id="attachment_968" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-4.jpg"><img class="wp-image-968 size-full" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-4.jpg" alt="unnamed-4" width="361" height="481" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Tribute to Michael Jackson</p></div>
<p>After a yummy breakfast which we considered to be our lunch too, we drove to the Rock n&#8217; Roll Hall of Fame. A lot of travelers will just go to where the parking is for an attraction&#8230;not us! It&#8217;s a lot cheaper to scope out the area and get cheap or free parking. To park right near the museum is $25 stinking dollars! Dustin has an application on his iPhone that showed us a parking garage close by for about $3-4. We had a short walk but not too bad.</p>
<div id="attachment_965" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-965 size-full" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-1.jpg" alt="unnamed-1" width="361" height="481" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dustin considering wearing a Rolling Stones outfit</p></div>
<p>The museum was great! We both love music and find music history very interesting. I would&#8217;ve been disappointed for $25 per person though. Since we didn&#8217;t pay that, we enjoyed it a lot more. From Biggie Small&#8217;s t-shirt to Madonna&#8217;s cone bra, we saw it all! We spent probably 2 or 3 hours there and then were on our way home. Currently they have a Beatles exhibit that has some of the member&#8217;s pianos and the Music Festival Experience. We were excited for the music festival exhibit but weren&#8217;t very impressed. There was a movie and some artifacts from Woodstock. What I loved most was seeing clothing from artists.</p>
<p>Overall it was a spectacular get-a-way for our anniversary. I believe the Wyndham package is always going on and the <a href="http://www.clevelandart.org/" target="_blank">Cleveland Museum of Art</a> is always free.</p>

<p>After looking online, I decided we should check out Cleveland. We&#8217;ve been to Columbus and Cincinnati since moving back to Ohio and haven&#8217;t spent a lot of time exploring up north. I was hesitant about downtown hotels and was curious about the walkability of the city. After spending a lot of time looking at hotels I decided I wanted to stay at the <a href="http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/ohio/the-tudor-arms-hotel-cleveland-a-doubletree-by-hilton-CLEUCDT/index.html" target="_blank">Tudor Arms Hotel by DoubleTree</a>. After looking more, I realized it wasn&#8217;t in a very walkable area and we&#8217;d have to drive around too much. I&#8217;d still love to stay there, but since it&#8217;s so close to the Cleveland Clinic, I&#8217;m not sure if they run many specials. We also looked at the <a href="http://www.gliddenhouse.com/" target="_blank">Glidden House</a> which is a B &amp; B near the museum campus.</p>
<div id="attachment_946" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-20.jpg"><img class="wp-image-946" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-20.jpg" alt="unnamed-20" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Inside the theater</p></div>
<p>In the end, we settled on the <a href="http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/ohio/cleveland/wyndham-cleveland-at-playhousesquare/hotel-overview" target="_blank">Wyndham</a> downtown at <a href="http://www.playhousesquare.org/" target="_blank">Playhouse Square</a>. The Wyndham had packages that made the stay much more affordable.

<p>Playhouse Square is the theater district of Cleveland. The Wyndham is located right on the square and you can see both the chandelier and the playhouse sign from the front door. Our room was on the fourteenth floor and we had a great view of the Playhouse Square sign which was lit up at night. The theaters were within seconds of the entrance and there were also many restaurants and bars. As soon as we checked into our room we fell asleep on the massive king bed. Once we awoke we got ready to see Casablanca at the <a href="http://www.playhousesquare.org/venues/detail/palace-theatre" target="_blank">Connor Palace Theater</a>. Before entering the theater we made a stop at Starbucks and ordered an Iced Caramel Macchiato.</p>
<p>After we reserved our hotel I looked up performances to see. For only $5 I found that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)" target="_blank">Casablanca</a> was showing at the Palace Theater. I was really excited since Dustin and I once watched parts of it on a cruise ship under the stars and remember that moment fondly. (So romantic) For $10, how couldn&#8217;t you go see it? What we weren&#8217;t expecting was the beauty of the theater. The Connor Palace has been restored beautifully. We felt as if we had stepped back in time when we walked in the doors. The crowd was a wonderful mix of families, singles and couples. Some were dressed up, others weren&#8217;t. There was popcorn served in traditional boxes and a bar open. We grabbed a box of popcorn and made our way up into the balcony. The architecture was honestly so amazing. As we found out seats we listened to a live orchestra. About 400 others filled with space. Before the black and white movie began, there were cartoons played. The room filled with laughter and cheering. It was a magical experience. The movie proved to be excellent. I can&#8217;t think of a shared experience from the last year I&#8217;ve cherished more with Dustin &#8211; crunching on popcorn while watching one of the best movies in the world.</p>

<p>After the movie we were really hungry. We took out the car and headed to Ohio City for the best pizza in Ohio! <a href="http://barcento.com/" target="_blank">Bar Cento</a> is a happening spot and was filled since the Gay Games were happening. We ordered a large fry which we could only finish 1/2 of! In addition to the fry we ordered a pizza to share. (Gone before I had a chance to take a picture) The restaurant is laid back but really buzzing. There is a huge bar space in the back with couches and even a pool table. There were a lot of people there even at midnight.</p>
<p>Dustin wanted something sweet so we hit up <a href="http://mitchellshomemade.com/" target="_blank">Mitchell&#8217;s Ice Cream</a>. We shared a tasting duo and got Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup and Caramel Fudge Brownie. It was some of the best ice cream I&#8217;ve ever had and the shop is open really late! After eating and exploring more, we made our way back to the hotel where we chilled and watched cable (a luxury since we don&#8217;t have it at home). The next morning we got to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!</p>
<p>$10 Movie at Connor Palace, $5 Popcorn, $5 Starbucks shared, $4 Ice Cream, $1 Parking, $25 dinner at Bar Cento = $50 Date Out</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-933" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-5.jpg" alt="unnamed-5" width="267" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>July 30th marked our four year anniversary. It&#8217;s pretty hard to believe I&#8217;ve been a MRS for that long! As usual, we decided to go on a mini-adventure to celebrate. I organized a fun trip that included museums and yummy food on the cheap. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of what we did:</p>
<div id="attachment_931" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-1.jpg" alt="unnamed-1" width="150" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Driving up to Cleveland</p></div>
<p>On Saturday, August 9th we took our time waking up and packed. We left for Cleveland around 11:00am. Our first stop was a restaurant known for one thing: it&#8217;s massive grilled cheeses! <a href="http://meltbarandgrilled.com/" target="_blank">Melt Bar and Grilled</a> is a cheese lovers dream-come-true! Humongous sandwiches are packed with things like: pork belly, lasagna, crispy battered chicken, homemade meatballs and eggplant. The menu alone will take you at least twenty minutes to look over. Since we were going to visit the <a href="http://www.clevelandart.org/" target="_blank">Cleveland Museum of Art</a>, we stopped in at the location in Cleveland Heights.</p>
<div id="attachment_932" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed.jpg"><img class="wp-image-932" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="150" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Driving selfie</p></div>
<p>As we walked inside, we knew we would love every minute of it. Kitchy light up santa clauses and Easter rabbits were on display with exposed brick and vintage Dairy Queen signs. The menus were plastered onto old record covers. There was a large bar and plenty of people. We couldn&#8217;t help but giggle at a super hipster couple who not only had matching glasses but had matching hats. I looked around and couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes: the grilled cheeses were the biggest I&#8217;d ever seen! HUGE. LARGE. GIGANTIC. The portions were enough to share with 2-3 people. Dustin and I couldn&#8217;t decide on a sandwich to share so we each went out own way.</p>
<p>I ordered the Mushroom Melt which included garlic mushrooms, caramel port onions, arugula and provolone. Dustin went kinda crazy and ordered the Caribbean Jerk War Pig which had jerk spiced pulled pork and seared pork belly, mango habanero chutney, caribbean slaw, fried sweet plantains and pepper jack cheese. Each sandwich came with a large order of fries. Dustin couldn&#8217;t finish his and I finished mine but couldn&#8217;t take on the fries. (Mine was a little smaller). Instead of ordering a beer we opted for a handcrafted soda. Delicious. The sandwiches were $11-13. Not bad for the amount of food and atmosphere.</p>

<p>After hitting Melt, we drive about six minutes to the Cleveland Museum of Art. The museum is excellent and is absolutely free! One of the ways we saved money was that we parked on the street. We drove around and found metered parking which was less than $1 for about an hour and a half. We walked a little bit, but not too bad. The parking at the museum is $8. Exploring the museum was fun. They have a really cool knights exhibit with armor and weapons. Dustin and I really loved seeing the Christian pieces and the modern art section. There were furniture pieces from Frank Lloyd Wright and paintings by Monet. Very educational and really fun! Oh, and did I say free?</p>
<div id="attachment_940" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-3.jpg"><img class="wp-image-940" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-3.jpg" alt="unnamed-3" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A royal chair at the museum</p></div>

<p>For this portion of the trip we spent money on  the lunch and parking. Our lunch was $25 without tip. (2 meals and a drink to share) If we had had a refrigerator it could have easily fed us twice! The parking was $1. After we went to the museum, we checked into our hotel downtown and took a nap!

She&#8217;s pretty awesome and asked us to help chaperone her field trip to Columbus. Melissa has a GIGANTIC heart for kids and she&#8217;s always planning fun things for them to do. It&#8217;s difficult to get parents and relatives to come on her trips since they are during the day.</p>
<p>In comes The Montgomery&#8217;s! Since we both work from home, it&#8217;s easier for us to change our schedule around and help out (AKA working on weekends). We helped out before Christmas and got to go to a Cleveland Cavilers game. It was tiring but really informative. To begin, we take the kids to a local college and then we take them to an <a href="http://www.fcclainc.org/" target="_blank">FCCLA</a> event at the Nationwide Arena in downtown Columbus. I hadn&#8217;t heard of FCCLA until I met Melissa. It&#8217;s basically a leadership club that promotes &#8220;personal growth and leadership development through Family and Consumer Sciences education.&#8221; Melissa was a state leader for four years and enjoys being a part of the organization.</p>
<p>The event at the <a href="http://bluejackets.nhl.com/" target="_blank">Blue Jackets</a> includes having professionals come and present to the high schoolers. They are able to ask questions and learn about college. Including in the presenters were a director of marketing, a sales person, and a chef. It was very cool to hear about jobs and also to tour the stadium. We also took the students to <a href="https://www.ohiodominican.edu/" target="_blank">Ohio Dominican University</a>, a college in Columbus and they took a tour. I was excited that we got hats that said the Blue Jackets and got to go to the game! It&#8217;s really awesome that we get to help out with things like this. You fall in love with the kids and laugh a lot.</p>

<p>Tuesday, March 11th:</p>
<p>Morning: Dustin worked in the morning and then we ate lunch at Wendys. We headed out to <a href="http://www.niagaraonthelake.com/page/Featured_Events" target="_blank">Niagara On the Lake </a>for wine tours and a chocolate factory tour. I somehow forgot our vouchers in the room but we still enjoyed ourselves. We got lost on the way there and Dustin ended up accidentally running into a strip club for directions. It was hilarious when he walked out laughing. I didn&#8217;t believe him until we looked at the sign for &#8220;Private Eyes&#8221; and &#8220;Jugs and Wings&#8221; We thought it was a diner. We ended up going to a huge ice winery looking for the chocolate factory which resembled a castle. Once we finally got to our tour we couldn&#8217;t believe we made it in time! The tour was really well put together at <a href="http://www.chocolatefx.ca/" target="_blank">Chocolate FX</a>. We got to see into the factory and learn about how chocolate is made. There were kids on the tour and they seemed to love it too. At the beginning and end you could try unlimited samples. This was a huge bonus as we stood and had a zillion chocolate covered coffee beans. With our voucher we got 2 chocolate covered strawberries and we purchased two ice wine truffles.</p>
<p>We explored the area and were impressed by the HUGE houses. Everywhere you looked were wineries and it was nice just driving around. Niagara On the Lake is only a thirty minute drive from Niagara Falls. We stopped in at <a href="http://www.sunnybrookfarmwinery.com/" target="_blank">Sunnybrook Farm Estate Winery</a>. It was a quaint little winery with free flights for two that I found a coupon for. We got to try ice wine and lots of fruit wines. We ended up having to purchase the Peach Ice Wine. It was so incredible! It was gone before we headed home. <a href="http://www.angel-inn.com/" target="_blank">Angel Inn</a> is a historic inn and restaurant in Old Town. We weren&#8217;t hungry but checked it out and walked around. There&#8217;s a ghost tale surrounding the place and we were impressed by the 18th century floors. Walking around Old Town was fun but the shops were all alike and pricey.</p>

<p>Evening: Heading back to Niagara Falls, we went along the Niagara River and got to see beautiful homes and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moses_Niagara_Hydroelectric_Power_Station" target="_blank">Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station</a>. Checking into the <a href="http://www.embassysuitesniagara.com/" target="_blank">Embassy</a> was easy. Dustin refused to pay $35 for valet parking and dropped me off. We parked at the Casino for only $5! Our room took our breathe away. On the 27th floor we had the most magnificent view of the falls. I can&#8217;t remember a hotel room where we had a better view. Two chairs were facing the window and we sat for a bit and took it all in. The room was BIG! I loved the jacuzzi but we didn&#8217;t need the living room with couch, dining table, and TV. We&#8217;ve learnt that we don&#8217;t need a lot of space in a hotel room but this was worth the view. After we got ready, we went to the Manager&#8217;s Reception. All Embassy Suites have an event in the evening that includes free drinks and snacks. Some are better than others. We each grabbed a drink and snacks. Dustin was over-joyed they offered hummus. We sat and enjoyed the view of the falls and then checked in to The Keg.</p>
<p><a href="http://fallsviewrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">The Keg </a>was our &#8220;fancy dinner.&#8221; It was on the falls on the 9th floor of the hotel. The <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/21780a77-1267-41df-8512-fc8bbfa2872e" target="_blank">Groupon </a>voucher had came with a $30 off coupon. We waited for a table by the window and weren&#8217;t disappointed! Our meal was fantastic. I ordered the Chicken Supreme which was a chicken breast filled with mushrooms and a balsamic cream sauce. It came with a twice baked potato and vegetables. Dustin ordered a teriyaki steak. As a appetizer we had mushrooms with  cream cheese and crab. After a great dinner we headed to the room to enjoy the view and eat our chocolates and drink the rest of our wine! I also enjoyed the whirlpool tub.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Wednesday, March 12th:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We were planning on going home this day. We woke up early and had breakfast at the hotel. A neat thing about the Embassy is that you get to sit in The Keg for breakfast. Had we had known that we would get a free meal with a view of the falls the next morning, we may have not spent as much on the meal before. BUT it was delicious and special. You couldn&#8217;t see the falls as well because of the snow. It was snowing a lot! We headed over to the <a href="http://imaxniagara.com/" target="_blank">IMAX movie</a> which was included. It was cool because Dustin had never been to an IMAX. I prayed for an opportunity to give away our extra two tickets and a nice Canadian family were paying for theirs. We were able to save them $40 for the two adult tickets. It was really great helping them out. They even had their daughter thank us. Attractions here are so expensive. I probably wouldn&#8217;t do a lot without coupons and vouchers. The movie was fun. It told the story of the falls. It was called Niagara: Miracles, Myth and Magic. Our tickets included 1/2 off of the<a href="http://imaxniagara.com/daredevil-exhibit/" target="_blank"> Daredevil Exhibit.</a> This was one of my favorite things in the entire trip. You got to see footage of people going over the falls and see the contraptions that went over. It was creepy seeing barrels people died in&#8230;but it was very educational! We both jumped in a few and took photos. Afterward we used up our tokens at <a href="http://www.piratescoveniagarafalls.com/" target="_blank">Captain Jack&#8217;s Pirate Cove </a>and then headed out. The weather was terrible. There were many accidents and we only made it to Buffalo. After calls from parents and prayer we decided to stay in a hotel. We stayed and worked and enjoyed free cookies until the blizzard settled and left the next morning. We later found out there were two huge car pile ups in Ohio! So glad to have gotten home safe.</p>
<div id="attachment_909" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unnamed-9.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-909" alt="unnamed-9" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unnamed-9.jpg" width="340" height="454" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">At the Daredevil Exhibit.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_910" style="width: 615px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unnamed-35.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-910" alt="unnamed-35" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unnamed-35.jpg" width="605" height="454" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Going over the falls at the Daredevil Exhibit</p></div>
<p>Overall the trip was amazing. More than finding deals and planning trips, I enjoy actually taking them. There&#8217;s something magical that happens when you&#8217;re in a new place and experiencing new things together. As we live for Jesus, He&#8217;s taken us places we would have never dreamt of. On our way home we just kept talking about how good God is all the time. He&#8217;s given us this passion for challenging the status quo and living differently.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Valentine’s Day was extra special this year.<b><b> </b></b></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Our good friend Lindsey decided to get tattooed with us by Ali McGregor from <a href="http://www.capcitytattooco.com/" target="_blank">Cap City Tattoo</a>. Lindsey was inked with a beautiful tribute to our good friend Jon Pound who passed away two years ago from cancer. He had always dreamed of going to India and loved books about Ghandi and Mother Teresa. He had the word “Hope” in Hindi tattooed above his chemotherapy port. A lot of our friends and his family members have gotten the same tattoo as a tribute to him and his calling. Lindsey helped design the lettering and had the tattoo done above her heart. A group of friends and us came to support her. Chris, surprised everyone by taking off her sweatshirt to reveal a t-shirt with Jon’s face on it! We all laughed and cried a little as we remembered our good friend. Among all who were there was: Spencer, Chris and Kenzie, Lindsey and Dustin and I.</p>

<h2>My Vintage Frame</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Inspired by a white-board, and empty frame&#8230;I got an antique frame with the word “empathy” tattooed on my left wrist. God is constantly bringing people to my mind to pray for and I am always scribbling with sharpies (I have the 80’s inspired set) on my arm. Now that I have a blank frame, I can place people’s names or other types of words and concepts to meditate on, on my wrist. I’ve already had many names, quotes, and Bible verses written in my perfect frame. This tattoo was extremely painful and probably the worst one I’ve gotten. The traditional banner hits my wrist bone on both sides and the nerve endings hurt like crazy. I braved it out though and Alli, our artist, even called me her “brave little soldier.” (for the record, I didn’t cry!)</p>
<h2> The Compass</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Dustin continued to work on his “nautical themed arm” and got a beautiful compass on his forearm. I think it’s really awesome and it flows really well with the shape of his arm. He said it didn’t hurt at all and really enjoyed getting it done. His next tattoo will probably be of a gigantic ship as soon as we have the money to invest.</p>
<h2> Our Date</h2>
<p dir="ltr">After grabbing a delicious lunch of butternut squash soup and chicken salad on a croissant from What’s For Dessert, we headed to C-bus with coffee in tow. We listened to great music and we were excited to hang out with our friends at the tattoo studio. Once there we all took turns running over to the coffee house across the street in the historic district of Columbus and grabbed lattes and Cliff bars. After eight hours there, Dustin and I were ready to eat. We drove to Easton Town Center and I got to go to my all time favorite store: <a href="http://www.lushusa.com/" target="_blank">LUSH Cosmetics</a>. (More on them later). I purchased some bath bombs and natural deodorant and then we were seated at <a href="http://www.pfchangs.com/index.aspx" target="_blank">P.F. Changs</a> for a late dinner. Our waiter noticed the familiar black-trash-bag-like wraps on our arms and asked about our tattoos. We decided to have a go at the Prixe Fix Menu which included two entrees, an appetizer, two soups, and two desserts. We devoured the lettuce wraps and sipped the soup. We ordered sweet and sour chicken and a spicy chicken dish and shared, reaching over each other’s plates. After eating so much, we asked for our dessert to go and after getting home and taking a bubble bath with my new bath bomb I layed in the bed and ate my tiramisu! Honestly, this Valentine’s Day was one of the BEST and I was so excited to spend time with the love of my life and some of our dearest friends. So many people forget to celebrate love and relationships everyday and it was a great time to step back and reflect on how fortunate we are to have each other and other amazing humans in our lives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignright  wp-image-590" title="mail box" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/mail-box.jpg" alt="mail box" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/mail-box.jpg 500w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/mail-box-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />Since leaving college I’ve found myself perpetually broke. “Broke” not in the sense that I can’t afford ramen noodles, but “broke” in the sense that I can’t go out sometimes, order indulgent magazine subscriptions and afford <a href="http://www.meltingpot.com/" target="_blank">The Melting Pot</a> or The Signature Lounge on the 96th floor of the John Hancock building in Chicago.</p>
<p>To be honest, since being married we’ve both been successfully employed and have made enough money to live pretty well but the occasional indulgence can throw our budget off or leave us feeling guilty because we love social justice and the poor. Whenever I want to buy the latest eyeliner or go out to the hippest lounge in Chi-town Dustin’s always squirming and adding that we can hit up alternatives and save cash for our travels. He’s right.</p>
<p>It’s hard to justify spending $50 a year on Whole Living Magazine or Vogue when there are homeless people sleeping on the “L” on our way to work. It’s even harder to hand over $100 for a night out at The Melting Pot (a really cool fondue restaurant) or $40 for cocktails at a new lounge when there are millions of children being enslaved due to Human Trafficking.</p>

<p>I read about getting free things online while Googling it. Someone I knew had mentioned that she got free samples on a popular blog and I was in awe. Free? Free shipping and free items that I could use? Things like DVD’s, American Apparel clothes, perfume, magazine subscriptions, over the counter medicines I use all the time like Advil and Tylenol, and purses could be free? I thought there had to be a catch. Perhaps you had to blog about the brands (I didn’t have time for a blog) or maybe you had to pay shipping costs and call and cancel subscriptions all the time? Nope. The article assured there were no catches. So I made a list of websites that gave away free stuff and began signing up.</p>
<p>By golly it worked! Before I knew it I was receiving samples and gifts in the mail. I acquired free coupons for makeup and medicine&#8230;I even got clothing. There are enough subscriptions to Food and Wine, Caribbean Travel, and Photography Magazine to fill six doctors’ offices. I didn’t believe it at first and always checked to make sure I didn’t have to cancel subscriptions or was charged on my debit card (I didn’t and I wasn’t.) Two years later I still check out the websites that post free things and receive books, food samples, and free event tickets.</p>

<p>Ok, so I get that you get free stuff and it&#8217;s awesome but how can I?</p>
<p><strong>Free Stuff Websites</strong><br />
The two websites that I have found and can refer you to without a shadow of a doubt that you’ll receive free things (and not be charged) are <a href="http://freestufftimes.com/" target="_blank">Freestufftimes.com</a> and <a href="http://www.heyitsfree.net/" target="_blank">Heyitsfree.net</a>. These two websites are where I’ve gotten most of my free items from. Once you go to the websites simply look for the free items that interest you (This may/may not be all of them!). Follow the directions offered by the website and wait to see your free stuff in the mail. Remember that some items are time sensitive and only give certain amounts of samples out. The website will tell you. If you are unsure if the offer is expired you can simply click on the comments section under the offer and see what others are saying. Another great aspect of Freestufftimes.com is the “What I Got” section which lists and provides pictures of things other users received.</p>
<p><strong>Target &amp; Walmart Samples</strong></p>
<p>You can periodically check Target and Walmart’s websites to find offers for free samples often. I’ve received many great samples from each. Sam’s Club and Costco also offer free samples for members online. I’m not a member thus haven’t tried any.</p>
<p><strong>Coupons</strong></p>
<p>In addition to free items you can look up free coupons from tons of blogs and websites. Begin getting coupons by checking out <a href="http://www.freecoupons.com/" target="_blank">Freecoupons.com</a>. Coupons are also offered on both free stuff websites (freestufftimes.com and heyitsfree.net) which can help you grab those $10 pistachios we both know you want.</p>
<h2>Tips For Getting Free Things<img class="alignright  wp-image-592" title="meal" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/meal.jpg" alt="meal" width="420" height="315" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/meal.jpg 600w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/meal-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /></h2>
<p>1. Always make sure it’s free. Even though you can sign up with confidence on both websites I mentioned you should always double check and make sure the offer is still valid.</p>
<p>2. Open a “spam” email account to receive newsletters and confirmation emails. On many “free” offers they will want you to offer up an email or receive a newsletter in exchange for a free item. Fear not! Simply open a new email account for spam. You can also use “fake” email accounts by through <a href="http://www.fakemailgenerator.com/" target="_blank">Fake Mail Generator</a>. These fake email accounts will allow you enough time to confirm an email then close them. (Dustin and I do this all the time!)</p>
<p>3. It doesn’t hurt to “like” things on Facebook. Get the free item then “unlike.” If you do love their services or item stay “liking” them.</p>
<p>4. Use autofill on your computer. This program that is built into most browsers saves your information and fills it in automatically for you. This way you don’t have to fill out a ton of information to get free items.</p>
<p>5. Recycle junk. By signing up to get free things you inadvertently get mail (such as newsletters, updates, etc). Try your hardest to recycle.</p>
<p>6. Thank organizations. If you receive something in the mail that you love, thank the organization. This small act of gratefulness keeps them giving out free stuff.</p>
<p>Enjoy getting free things in your mailbox!</p>
