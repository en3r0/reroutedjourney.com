				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;m preparing for India I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about photography and our new Nikon. In attempt to smother it with the love akin to a first-born-male-child-in China (or the like) I&#8217;ve found a few photography purchases to contemplate. Now, as you know I&#8217;m trying to be a responsible adult and not purchase cute, un-needed items in slew of our trip to India BUT I couldn&#8217;t help but <del>lust after</del> share the following items.</p>
<div id="attachment_288" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/camera-cookie-cutters/"><img class="size-full wp-image-288 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/camera-cookie-cutters-45ee_600.0000001323072972.jpg" alt="Camera Cookie Cutter Set" width="600" height="399" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Camera Cookie Cutter Set</p></div>
<p>I can imagine myself in the cutest Anthropologie apron baking these adorable cookies and sharing them with our hip-photography loving neighbors. Included in the set is an SLR, a classic range finder and a twin reflex camera. For only $18 and a life supply of picture-worthy cookies; I&#8217;d shutter imagining NOT having them in my domesticated life.</p>
<div id="attachment_290" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.artatheart.co.uk/artatheart/2011/09/i-felt-photogenic-camera-case.html"><img class="size-full wp-image-290 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/6a011571d8bb99970b015434f6fe8a970c-800wi.jpg" alt="Felt Camera Case" width="550" height="503" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I Felt Photogenic Camera Case</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mod Cloth always has the very best purses and accessories. When I came upon this beautiful camera case I about ran out and bought a camera to fit in the case! Later it dawned on me that this cute, retro case could also be used to hold accessories and other much-loved electronics.</p>
<div id="attachment_291" style="width: 453px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://microsites.lomography.com/diana/"><img class=" wp-image-291  " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/transition03.jpg" alt="Diana F+ Camera" width="443" height="348" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Diana F+</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mad love to the cult-favorite Diana F+. After receiving a beautiful light blue one as a Christmas gift I still haven&#8217;t purchased the film which is about $25 a roll. I&#8217;m dying to get out and take some cool lomo-shots and will just have to bite the bullet and cough up the change for the expensive film. If you haven&#8217;t heard of lomography check it out and let me know your thoughts.</p>
