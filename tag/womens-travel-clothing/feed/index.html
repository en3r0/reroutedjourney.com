<p>After confirming our plane tickets to New Delhi, India it occurred to me that:</p>
<p>1. We were truly leaving to travel the world.<br />
2. Dustin was frowning about checking luggage as it can be an extra $100 per person.<br />
3. I would need to pack all of my belongings in my carry on backpack.<span id="more-438"></span></p>
<p><strong>The first point didn’t cause me much panic.</strong> We’ve been free spirits since the day we met and have moved an average of once every six months since being married.</p>
<p><strong>The second point made sense.</strong> Why would we check luggage that we didn’t need and pay hundreds of dollars? We could easily carry on our packs and more than 35 liters wasn&#8217;t realistic to lug around India anyways. (If you haven’t met Dustin or I, take my word that we aren’t necessarily “athletic” in any sense of the word.)</p>
<p><strong>The third point left me uneasy.</strong> The third point brought to life every idea I’d ever had about travelling the world with only the “clothes on my back.” I do really like clothes, makeup and well, anything to improve my personal hygiene. Packing everything I would need to travel in one backpack caused me to sit quietly and go through my favorite clothing and mentally “pack.” A 35 liter backpack couldn’t be enough, could it? Whether it is or isn’t enough for all of my prized possessions, it’s all I’m bringing on the plane July 16th to leave the U.S. Here’s the list of clothing that Dustin and I decided upon for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 T-shirts</li>
<li>1 pair of lightweight travel cargo pants</li>
<li>1 travel skirt</li>
<li>2 pairs of socks</li>
<li>2 layering tank tops</li>
<li>1 long-sleeved top</li>
<li>1 jacket</li>
<li>2 bras</li>
<li>3-4 pairs of underwear (I insisted on more than 2)</li>
<li>1 bathing suit</li>
<li>1 cardigan (ok, I just added this while typing this post)</li>
<li>1 pair of sandals</li>
<li>1 pair of trainers</li>
</ul>
<p>20 items of clothing. It seems sparse when thinking about it. When typing it out I feel rich. I guess based on the fact that most people in the world live on one (two if lucky) changes of clothing, it makes me realize I can do this.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while I research and gather the best gear out there to last more than a year (that is, without being stolen), I’ll be posting and reviewing my top picks and links to where you can find and purchase them online. (<a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/i-never-dreamt-of-wearing-one-pair-of-underwear-for-a-year-or-two/">Beginning with the best travel undies ever!</a>) To be honest in a way the idea of only carrying the clothes I own on my back is freeing. Two words I leave you with: less laundry!</p>
