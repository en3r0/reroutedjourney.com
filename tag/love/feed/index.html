				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-933" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-5.jpg" alt="unnamed-5" width="267" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>July 30th marked our four year anniversary. It&#8217;s pretty hard to believe I&#8217;ve been a MRS for that long! As usual, we decided to go on a mini-adventure to celebrate. I organized a fun trip that included museums and yummy food on the cheap. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of what we did:</p>
<div id="attachment_931" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-1.jpg" alt="unnamed-1" width="150" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Driving up to Cleveland</p></div>
<p>On Saturday, August 9th we took our time waking up and packed. We left for Cleveland around 11:00am. Our first stop was a restaurant known for one thing: it&#8217;s massive grilled cheeses! <a href="http://meltbarandgrilled.com/" target="_blank">Melt Bar and Grilled</a> is a cheese lovers dream-come-true! Humongous sandwiches are packed with things like: pork belly, lasagna, crispy battered chicken, homemade meatballs and eggplant. The menu alone will take you at least twenty minutes to look over. Since we were going to visit the <a href="http://www.clevelandart.org/" target="_blank">Cleveland Museum of Art</a>, we stopped in at the location in Cleveland Heights.</p>
<div id="attachment_932" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed.jpg"><img class="wp-image-932" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="150" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Driving selfie</p></div>
<p>As we walked inside, we knew we would love every minute of it. Kitchy light up santa clauses and Easter rabbits were on display with exposed brick and vintage Dairy Queen signs. The menus were plastered onto old record covers. There was a large bar and plenty of people. We couldn&#8217;t help but giggle at a super hipster couple who not only had matching glasses but had matching hats. I looked around and couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes: the grilled cheeses were the biggest I&#8217;d ever seen! HUGE. LARGE. GIGANTIC. The portions were enough to share with 2-3 people. Dustin and I couldn&#8217;t decide on a sandwich to share so we each went out own way.</p>
<p>I ordered the Mushroom Melt which included garlic mushrooms, caramel port onions, arugula and provolone. Dustin went kinda crazy and ordered the Caribbean Jerk War Pig which had jerk spiced pulled pork and seared pork belly, mango habanero chutney, caribbean slaw, fried sweet plantains and pepper jack cheese. Each sandwich came with a large order of fries. Dustin couldn&#8217;t finish his and I finished mine but couldn&#8217;t take on the fries. (Mine was a little smaller). Instead of ordering a beer we opted for a handcrafted soda. Delicious. The sandwiches were $11-13. Not bad for the amount of food and atmosphere.</p>

<p>After hitting Melt, we drive about six minutes to the Cleveland Museum of Art. The museum is excellent and is absolutely free! One of the ways we saved money was that we parked on the street. We drove around and found metered parking which was less than $1 for about an hour and a half. We walked a little bit, but not too bad. The parking at the museum is $8. Exploring the museum was fun. They have a really cool knights exhibit with armor and weapons. Dustin and I really loved seeing the Christian pieces and the modern art section. There were furniture pieces from Frank Lloyd Wright and paintings by Monet. Very educational and really fun! Oh, and did I say free?</p>
<div id="attachment_940" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-3.jpg"><img class="wp-image-940" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-3.jpg" alt="unnamed-3" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A royal chair at the museum</p></div>

<div id="attachment_941" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-11.jpg"><img class="wp-image-941" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-11.jpg" alt="unnamed-11" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An exhibit</p></div>
<p>For this portion of the trip we spent money on  the lunch and parking. Our lunch was $25 without tip. (2 meals and a drink to share) If we had had a refrigerator it could have easily fed us twice! The parking was $1. After we went to the museum, we checked into our hotel downtown and took a nap!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unnamed-22.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-921 alignleft" alt="unnamed-2" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unnamed-22.jpg" width="547" height="410" /></a>Our good friend is a teacher at a local high school. She&#8217;s pretty awesome and asked us to help chaperone her field trip to Columbus. Melissa has a GIGANTIC heart for kids and she&#8217;s always planning fun things for them to do. It&#8217;s difficult to get parents and relatives to come on her trips since they are during the day.</p>
<p>In comes The Montgomery&#8217;s! Since we both work from home, it&#8217;s easier for us to change our schedule around and help out (AKA working on weekends). We helped out before Christmas and got to go to a Cleveland Cavilers game. It was tiring but really informative. To begin, we take the kids to a local college and then we take them to an <a href="http://www.fcclainc.org/" target="_blank">FCCLA</a> event at the Nationwide Arena in downtown Columbus. I hadn&#8217;t heard of FCCLA until I met Melissa. It&#8217;s basically a leadership club that promotes &#8220;personal growth and leadership development through Family and Consumer Sciences education.&#8221; Melissa was a state leader for four years and enjoys being a part of the organization.</p>
<p>The event at the <a href="http://bluejackets.nhl.com/" target="_blank">Blue Jackets</a> includes having professionals come and present to the high schoolers. They are able to ask questions and learn about college. Including in the presenters were a director of marketing, a sales person, and a chef. It was very cool to hear about jobs and also to tour the stadium. We also took the students to <a href="https://www.ohiodominican.edu/" target="_blank">Ohio Dominican University</a>, a college in Columbus and they took a tour. I was excited that we got hats that said the Blue Jackets and got to go to the game! It&#8217;s really awesome that we get to help out with things like this. You fall in love with the kids and laugh a lot.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Valentine’s Day was extra special this year.<b><b> </b></b></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Our good friend Lindsey decided to get tattooed with us by Ali McGregor from <a href="http://www.capcitytattooco.com/" target="_blank">Cap City Tattoo</a>. Lindsey was inked with a beautiful tribute to our good friend Jon Pound who passed away two years ago from cancer. He had always dreamed of going to India and loved books about Ghandi and Mother Teresa. He had the word “Hope” in Hindi tattooed above his chemotherapy port. A lot of our friends and his family members have gotten the same tattoo as a tribute to him and his calling. Lindsey helped design the lettering and had the tattoo done above her heart. A group of friends and us came to support her. Chris, surprised everyone by taking off her sweatshirt to reveal a t-shirt with Jon’s face on it! We all laughed and cried a little as we remembered our good friend. Among all who were there was: Spencer, Chris and Kenzie, Lindsey and Dustin and I.</p>

<h2>My Vintage Frame</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Inspired by a white-board, and empty frame&#8230;I got an antique frame with the word “empathy” tattooed on my left wrist. God is constantly bringing people to my mind to pray for and I am always scribbling with sharpies (I have the 80’s inspired set) on my arm. Now that I have a blank frame, I can place people’s names or other types of words and concepts to meditate on, on my wrist. I’ve already had many names, quotes, and Bible verses written in my perfect frame. This tattoo was extremely painful and probably the worst one I’ve gotten. The traditional banner hits my wrist bone on both sides and the nerve endings hurt like crazy. I braved it out though and Alli, our artist, even called me her “brave little soldier.” (for the record, I didn’t cry!)</p>
<h2> The Compass</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Dustin continued to work on his “nautical themed arm” and got a beautiful compass on his forearm. I think it’s really awesome and it flows really well with the shape of his arm. He said it didn’t hurt at all and really enjoyed getting it done. His next tattoo will probably be of a gigantic ship as soon as we have the money to invest.</p>
<h2> Our Date</h2>
<p dir="ltr">After grabbing a delicious lunch of butternut squash soup and chicken salad on a croissant from What’s For Dessert, we headed to C-bus with coffee in tow. We listened to great music and we were excited to hang out with our friends at the tattoo studio. Once there we all took turns running over to the coffee house across the street in the historic district of Columbus and grabbed lattes and Cliff bars. After eight hours there, Dustin and I were ready to eat. We drove to Easton Town Center and I got to go to my all time favorite store: <a href="http://www.lushusa.com/" target="_blank">LUSH Cosmetics</a>. (More on them later). I purchased some bath bombs and natural deodorant and then we were seated at <a href="http://www.pfchangs.com/index.aspx" target="_blank">P.F. Changs</a> for a late dinner. Our waiter noticed the familiar black-trash-bag-like wraps on our arms and asked about our tattoos. We decided to have a go at the Prixe Fix Menu which included two entrees, an appetizer, two soups, and two desserts. We devoured the lettuce wraps and sipped the soup. We ordered sweet and sour chicken and a spicy chicken dish and shared, reaching over each other’s plates. After eating so much, we asked for our dessert to go and after getting home and taking a bubble bath with my new bath bomb I layed in the bed and ate my tiramisu! Honestly, this Valentine’s Day was one of the BEST and I was so excited to spend time with the love of my life and some of our dearest friends. So many people forget to celebrate love and relationships everyday and it was a great time to step back and reflect on how fortunate we are to have each other and other amazing humans in our lives.</p>
