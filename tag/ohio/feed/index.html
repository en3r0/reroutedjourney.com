				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_964" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_2185.jpg"><img class="wp-image-964" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_2185.jpg" alt="IMG_2185" width="400" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland</p></div>
<p>I realized that I never completely finished this travel series! A friend of mine mentioned it to me the other day and I logged on and realized I didn&#8217;t write about our time at The Rock n&#8217; Roll Hall of Fame.</p>
<div id="attachment_969" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-969" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1.jpg" alt="photo-1" width="400" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dustin exploring the museum</p></div>
<p>After staying the night in <a href="http://www.playhousesquare.org/" target="_blank">Playhouse Square</a> downtown Cleveland, we slept in a bit then went downstairs for a breakfast buffet. The buffet was included in our getaway package and was held at the <a href="http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/ohio/cleveland/wyndham-cleveland-at-playhousesquare/hotel-dining" target="_blank">Encore Restaurant</a>. As I mentioned earlier, <a href="http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/ohio/cleveland/wyndham-cleveland-at-playhousesquare/hotel-overview" target="_blank">The Wyndham</a> had packages that made the stay much more affordable. We purchased the Rock and Roll Package which included valet service for 24 hours, two tickets to the <a href="http://www.rockhall.com/" target="_blank">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, the room and a gourmet breakfast buffet in the morning. The total was $205 without tax. Parking would’ve been $20 minimum and tickets to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame were $25 each. The breakfast was about $13 per person. With the package, the savings made the hotel room only $109!</p>
<div id="attachment_968" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-4.jpg"><img class="wp-image-968 size-full" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-4.jpg" alt="unnamed-4" width="361" height="481" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Tribute to Michael Jackson</p></div>
<p>After a yummy breakfast which we considered to be our lunch too, we drove to the Rock n&#8217; Roll Hall of Fame. A lot of travelers will just go to where the parking is for an attraction&#8230;not us! It&#8217;s a lot cheaper to scope out the area and get cheap or free parking. To park right near the museum is $25 stinking dollars! Dustin has an application on his iPhone that showed us a parking garage close by for about $3-4. We had a short walk but not too bad.</p>
<div id="attachment_965" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-965 size-full" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-1.jpg" alt="unnamed-1" width="361" height="481" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dustin considering wearing a Rolling Stones outfit</p></div>
<p>The museum was great! We both love music and find music history very interesting. I would&#8217;ve been disappointed for $25 per person though. Since we didn&#8217;t pay that, we enjoyed it a lot more. From Biggie Small&#8217;s t-shirt to Madonna&#8217;s cone bra, we saw it all! We spent probably 2 or 3 hours there and then were on our way home. Currently they have a Beatles exhibit that has some of the member&#8217;s pianos and the Music Festival Experience. We were excited for the music festival exhibit but weren&#8217;t very impressed. There was a movie and some artifacts from Woodstock. What I loved most was seeing clothing from artists.</p>
<p>Overall it was a spectacular get-a-way for our anniversary. I believe the Wyndham package is always going on and the <a href="http://www.clevelandart.org/" target="_blank">Cleveland Museum of Art</a> is always free.</p>

<p>After looking online, I decided we should check out Cleveland. We&#8217;ve been to Columbus and Cincinnati since moving back to Ohio and haven&#8217;t spent a lot of time exploring up north. I was hesitant about downtown hotels and was curious about the walkability of the city. After spending a lot of time looking at hotels I decided I wanted to stay at the <a href="http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/ohio/the-tudor-arms-hotel-cleveland-a-doubletree-by-hilton-CLEUCDT/index.html" target="_blank">Tudor Arms Hotel by DoubleTree</a>. After looking more, I realized it wasn&#8217;t in a very walkable area and we&#8217;d have to drive around too much. I&#8217;d still love to stay there, but since it&#8217;s so close to the Cleveland Clinic, I&#8217;m not sure if they run many specials. We also looked at the <a href="http://www.gliddenhouse.com/" target="_blank">Glidden House</a> which is a B &amp; B near the museum campus.</p>
<div id="attachment_946" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-20.jpg"><img class="wp-image-946" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-20.jpg" alt="unnamed-20" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Inside the theater</p></div>
<p>In the end, we settled on the <a href="http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/ohio/cleveland/wyndham-cleveland-at-playhousesquare/hotel-overview" target="_blank">Wyndham</a> downtown at <a href="http://www.playhousesquare.org/" target="_blank">Playhouse Square</a>. The Wyndham had packages that made the stay much more affordable. We purchased the Rock and Roll Package which included valet service for 24 hours, two tickets to the <a href="http://www.rockhall.com/" target="_blank">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, the room and a gourmet breakfast buffet in the morning.

<p>Playhouse Square is the theater district of Cleveland. The Wyndham is located right on the square and you can see both the chandelier and the playhouse sign from the front door. Our room was on the fourteenth floor and we had a great view of the Playhouse Square sign which was lit up at night. The theaters were within seconds of the entrance and there were also many restaurants and bars. As soon as we checked into our room we fell asleep on the massive king bed. Once we awoke we got ready to see Casablanca at the <a href="http://www.playhousesquare.org/venues/detail/palace-theatre" target="_blank">Connor Palace Theater</a>. Before entering the theater we made a stop at Starbucks and ordered an Iced Caramel Macchiato.</p>
<p>After we reserved our hotel I looked up performances to see. For only $5 I found that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)" target="_blank">Casablanca</a> was showing at the Palace Theater. I was really excited since Dustin and I once watched parts of it on a cruise ship under the stars and remember that moment fondly. (So romantic) For $10, how couldn&#8217;t you go see it? What we weren&#8217;t expecting was the beauty of the theater. The Connor Palace has been restored beautifully. We felt as if we had stepped back in time when we walked in the doors. The crowd was a wonderful mix of families, singles and couples. Some were dressed up, others weren&#8217;t. There was popcorn served in traditional boxes and a bar open. We grabbed a box of popcorn and made our way up into the balcony. The architecture was honestly so amazing. As we found out seats we listened to a live orchestra. About 400 others filled with space. Before the black and white movie began, there were cartoons played. The room filled with laughter and cheering. It was a magical experience. The movie proved to be excellent. I can&#8217;t think of a shared experience from the last year I&#8217;ve cherished more with Dustin &#8211; crunching on popcorn while watching one of the best movies in the world.</p>

<p>After the movie we were really hungry. We took out the car and headed to Ohio City for the best pizza in Ohio! <a href="http://barcento.com/" target="_blank">Bar Cento</a> is a happening spot and was filled since the Gay Games were happening. We ordered a large fry which we could only finish 1/2 of! In addition to the fry we ordered a pizza to share. (Gone before I had a chance to take a picture) The restaurant is laid back but really buzzing. There is a huge bar space in the back with couches and even a pool table. There were a lot of people there even at midnight.</p>
<p>Dustin wanted something sweet so we hit up <a href="http://mitchellshomemade.com/" target="_blank">Mitchell&#8217;s Ice Cream</a>. We shared a tasting duo and got Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup and Caramel Fudge Brownie. It was some of the best ice cream I&#8217;ve ever had and the shop is open really late! After eating and exploring more, we made our way back to the hotel where we chilled and watched cable (a luxury since we don&#8217;t have it at home). The next morning we got to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!</p>
<p>$10 Movie at Connor Palace, $5 Popcorn, $5 Starbucks shared, $4 Ice Cream, $1 Parking, $25 dinner at Bar Cento = $50 Date Out</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Valentine’s Day was extra special this year.<b><b> </b></b></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Our good friend Lindsey decided to get tattooed with us by Ali McGregor from <a href="http://www.capcitytattooco.com/" target="_blank">Cap City Tattoo</a>. Lindsey was inked with a beautiful tribute to our good friend Jon Pound who passed away two years ago from cancer. He had always dreamed of going to India and loved books about Ghandi and Mother Teresa. He had the word “Hope” in Hindi tattooed above his chemotherapy port. A lot of our friends and his family members have gotten the same tattoo as a tribute to him and his calling. Lindsey helped design the lettering and had the tattoo done above her heart. A group of friends and us came to support her. Chris, surprised everyone by taking off her sweatshirt to reveal a t-shirt with Jon’s face on it! We all laughed and cried a little as we remembered our good friend. Among all who were there was: Spencer, Chris and Kenzie, Lindsey and Dustin and I.</p>

<h2>My Vintage Frame</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Inspired by a white-board, and empty frame&#8230;I got an antique frame with the word “empathy” tattooed on my left wrist. God is constantly bringing people to my mind to pray for and I am always scribbling with sharpies (I have the 80’s inspired set) on my arm. Now that I have a blank frame, I can place people’s names or other types of words and concepts to meditate on, on my wrist. I’ve already had many names, quotes, and Bible verses written in my perfect frame. This tattoo was extremely painful and probably the worst one I’ve gotten. The traditional banner hits my wrist bone on both sides and the nerve endings hurt like crazy. I braved it out though and Alli, our artist, even called me her “brave little soldier.” (for the record, I didn’t cry!)</p>
<h2> The Compass</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Dustin continued to work on his “nautical themed arm” and got a beautiful compass on his forearm. I think it’s really awesome and it flows really well with the shape of his arm. He said it didn’t hurt at all and really enjoyed getting it done. His next tattoo will probably be of a gigantic ship as soon as we have the money to invest.</p>
<h2> Our Date</h2>
<p dir="ltr">After grabbing a delicious lunch of butternut squash soup and chicken salad on a croissant from What’s For Dessert, we headed to C-bus with coffee in tow. We listened to great music and we were excited to hang out with our friends at the tattoo studio. Once there we all took turns running over to the coffee house across the street in the historic district of Columbus and grabbed lattes and Cliff bars. After eight hours there, Dustin and I were ready to eat. We drove to Easton Town Center and I got to go to my all time favorite store: <a href="http://www.lushusa.com/" target="_blank">LUSH Cosmetics</a>. (More on them later). I purchased some bath bombs and natural deodorant and then we were seated at <a href="http://www.pfchangs.com/index.aspx" target="_blank">P.F. Changs</a> for a late dinner. Our waiter noticed the familiar black-trash-bag-like wraps on our arms and asked about our tattoos. We decided to have a go at the Prixe Fix Menu which included two entrees, an appetizer, two soups, and two desserts. We devoured the lettuce wraps and sipped the soup. We ordered sweet and sour chicken and a spicy chicken dish and shared, reaching over each other’s plates. After eating so much, we asked for our dessert to go and after getting home and taking a bubble bath with my new bath bomb I layed in the bed and ate my tiramisu! Honestly, this Valentine’s Day was one of the BEST and I was so excited to spend time with the love of my life and some of our dearest friends. So many people forget to celebrate love and relationships everyday and it was a great time to step back and reflect on how fortunate we are to have each other and other amazing humans in our lives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thursday and Friday we were so blessed to have the opportunity to go to the Kalahari in Sandusky, Ohio, the biggest indoor waterpark in all of the United States!<span id="more-79"></span> Whether attempting to surf on their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYPnVx7vDcg" target="_blank">Flowrider</a> or pushing each other along in the lazy river, we enjoyed the time to take a step back from preparing for our trip to India and working, to soak up some &#8220;indoor&#8221; sun and warmth.</p>
<p>Leaving on Thursday morning we grabbed Dustin&#8217;s favorite Carmel Macchiato from Starbucks and explored the backroads of Ohio on our way to Sandusky from Delaware. <a href="http://www.kalahariresorts.com/oh/specialoffers/bestrate/" target="_blank">The package we purchased</a> included our dinner, a one nights stay, tickets for two days to the waterpark, arcade tokens and a breakfast buffet. Taking advantage of our work flexibility we got a great middle-of-the-week deal. When we arrived we hurriedly checked into our room and made a beeline for the water park.</p>
<p>Kalahari is huge and has many rides, water slides, and an indoor wave pool. We jumped into the wave pool before running to the first slide, the Tanzanian Twister, which sends you down a shoot into a huge toilet bowl where you swirl around until you fall down the bottom hole into a 6 1/2 foot pool! As disorienting as the ride was, it was fun and the larger version named the Swahili Swirl (which could hold four individuals on a raft) became our favorite attraction in the whole park since we could make faces and yell together while being hurled into oblivion.</p>
<p>After climbing up and down steps a zillion times we decided to rest and recoup in the lazy river where we took turns re-enacting the Titanic &#8220;drowning scene&#8221; where I yelled for Leonardo (aka Dustin) to hold on as he slipped into the frigid waters to pop up and attempt to tip my inner tube and splash me and the confused onlookers.</p>
<p>Embracing our belief of living young we explored the Leopard&#8217;s Lair, a huge play park with water squirting from every corner and attempted to drench a few unsuspecting kids. After squirting and spraying we stood under the large bucket to get drenched then huddled while shrieking to the &#8220;grown up&#8221; hot tub.</p>
<p>Dinner at The Reserve was delicious and we took our gift card seriously, ordering a cocktail, two entrees and dessert. For once Dustin ordered better than me and we both tried his Stir Fry which was offered with 15-20 year old fermented soy sauce. My pasta was good but left me yearning for something sweet as I ordered their carmel and chocolate new york style cheesecake.</p>
<p>A highlight of our trip was feeding the most adorable ducks in the front pond of the resort. Lovingly named Tweedle Dee and Dumb by myself these little guys loved to take corn right out of the palm of your hand and also allowed you to pet them. I&#8217;ve never been so close to a grown duck in all of my life and would make the drive just to enjoy these little fellas. We also starred at the cute baby lion in the lobby which was taking pictures with guests willing to pay $40 or so.*</p>
<p>Time at the Big Game Room was one of our favorite parts of the trip. Although I didn&#8217;t win many tickets with Deal or No Deal we played skee ball and tried to win mass amounts of tickets with token games. At the end of a good hour or so we added our tickets together to purchase: a baby pink slinky, 90&#8217;s bracelets, a watermelon push pop, owl candy, and chewy sweet tarts. Enjoying our sweets by the lobby fire we relaxed and reflected on our day.</p>
<p>The next morning we awoke to grab breakfast and then slept another good hour thanks to the upgrade to a late check out. Braving the Flowrider we both mastered body boarding and rode the rest of the rides. On our way home we stopped at a quirky thrift shop and wandered around in an old graveyard overlooking the hills. A perfect ending to our trip included ice cream with the Montgomery&#8217;s (Dustin&#8217;s family) and Starbucks with my family.</p>
<p>Although we enjoyed our trip to the Kalahari we found it to be too pricey and not very relaxing for a couple with no kids. There aren&#8217;t a lot of adult activities and there are a ton of kids which can be hectic when looking for a get-a-way. As a couple we&#8217;d choose another resort to spend our time and money next time.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to take your kids to an indoor water park check out The Great Wolf Lodge, also in Sandusky, Ohio or Fort Rapids located in Columbus, Ohio. These resorts appear to be a little cheaper although the water parks are smaller in size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Unfortunately our camera took a swim in the wave pool which explains the lack of personal pictures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting another tattoo for awhile before leaving for India in July. It just so happened that I was sick for Valentine&#8217;s Day so I asked Dustin if I could get a tattoo instead of a romantic date. He obliged and before I knew it we were both at Cap City Tattoo in the Historic Old Towne of Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<div id="attachment_194" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-194 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Photo-on-2012-02-21-at-20.02-2.jpg" alt="Me Being Happy" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Me, happy with my tattoo</p></div>
<p>Cap City Tattoo is owned by Ali Macgregor, an awesome artist who has been featured in a ton of magazines and is one of very few tattoo shop owners. After hanging out at a local coffee shop with our friends Chris and Kenzie she drew up a great tattoo based off my references and soon I was under the gun. Her design was custom and included two flowers, and three leaves with a graphic element. I didn&#8217;t want the tattoo to look &#8220;realistic&#8221; but wanted it to look like someone just took a sharpie and drew flowers on my forearm. After talking with Ali we decided to have some shading around the inside of the flowers as you can see in the picture.</p>
<div id="attachment_195" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-195 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Photo-on-2012-02-21-at-20.01.jpg" alt="Art Nouveau Floral Tattoo" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Art Nouveau Floral</p></div>
<p>The tattoo itself took a little over an hour and was really painless which was surprising because of the placement. Although the tattoo didn&#8217;t hold a ton of meaning (I&#8217;m not big on meaningful, emotional tattoos) I am excited that it can/will represent my bond with my sister and my mum while I&#8217;m away in India, Thailand, and Cambodia. Whenever I look down I can remember that I have family in the states and that our love and genuine fondness of one another will help me through tough times when I&#8217;m away.</p>
<div id="attachment_196" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-196 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Photo-on-2012-02-21-at-20.02.jpg" alt="Art Nouveau Floral Tattoo Close Up" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Close Up: Still Healing</p></div>
<p>Dustin also got a tattoo that was smaller on his wrist that says the word &#8220;Action.&#8221; This correlates with his &#8220;Faith&#8221; tattoo because actions without faith is meaningless and vice versa. An artist named Phill DeAngulo did his and rocked it out. You can check out Cap City Tattoo <a href="http://www.capcitytattooco.com/alli-macgregor.html" target="_blank">here</a> and show them some love. If you&#8217;re in the area also grab some coffee at the shop across the street. They roast their own beans and have a killer caramel latte.</p>
