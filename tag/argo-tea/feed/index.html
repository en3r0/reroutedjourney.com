<p>Argo Tea is the new “Starbucks” of tea and Chicagoans know it. Advancing to Boston, New York, and St. Louis, this tea shop knows tea! With the zen-like green logo and enticing glass tea pots this tea shop located in numerous places around Chicago including Lakeview, the Loop and Streeterville, is a new hang out for tea and coffee goers alike.Argo is “passionate about bringing teas directly from growers around the world and blending them into unique and delicious beverages and teas.” With the mantra “one customer and one cup at a time,” Argo treats every customer who walks through their door as an old friend. If you’re lucky to live near one of these tea heavens you’ll soon get to know your tea Batistas and they’ll remember your order accordingly. Another plus at Argo is the free samples. Not sure if you’re a white or green tea guy/gal? Ask to sample a few blends and with the help of the Argo expert behind the counter you’ll be on your way to becoming a tea</p>

<p>connoisseur.Argo tea offers extremely unique blends such as the Mojitea, a non-alcoholic tea twist on the traditional Mojito and different tea smoothies. (I really love their raspberry tea smoothie and the tea sangria.) Diversity, creativity, charity, sustainability, and community are all values the company holds to.</p>
<p>My all-time favorite Argo Tea is on Broadway and has many couches and an upstairs loft to work and people watch. I’ve spent quite a few snowy days up there drinking a delicious Chai and watching the snowy Chicago CTA pass by. Argo is also perfect in the summer for grabbing an iced tea and sitting out on their patio. Dogs are welcome to join outside and water is usually provided for them. Wifi is free to use and most of the tables are outfitted with outlets for long use.</p>
<p>Another great aspect of Argo are their bottled teas to go and their tea-infused “snack pots.” My favorite snack pot was the turkey with black beans, mangoes, and brown rice. You can purchase loose leaf teas at the shop and create your own blends. Another great item to buy at the shop are their glass tea tumblers which are extremely cute and reasonably priced.</p>

<p>If you’re lucky to stumble upon one of the live performances at Argo you’ll be amazed at how cozy and friendly the atmosphere is. In January of last year the Chicago Blizzard of 2011 kept most people from work and left us to work from home. After fighting the cold and trudging up to Argo there was a free acoustic show playing and tons of artists visiting. Next time you’re in the neighborhood make sure to check out Argo and order the Vanilla Chai with Soy milk for no extra charge!</p>
