<p dir="ltr">If you find yourself bored of the typical all inclusive stay in Cancun, Mexico and in need of some adventure head over to the Isle of Mujeres, otherwise known as the Island of Women. This island, a part of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo boasts many adventures from sea turtle farms to the world famous MUSA, the world’s largest underwater museum.</p>
<div id="attachment_306" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-306 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/430426_10150751170723289_678288288_12424768_1805504908_n.jpg" alt="Car Ferry To Isle of Mujeres" width="960" height="636" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pigs Join Us on the Car Ferry</p></div>
<p>After booking an all inclusive stay at the five star resort, Playa del Palmer, my husband and I found ourselves in need of some adventure and elbow rubbing with some nationals. I read about the Isle of Mujeres and was shocked to find that the car ferry was within walking distance of our resort. In addition to grabbing some free bottled water, a change of clothes, and some sun block, we packed snacks like protein bars and goldfish to help us save money.</p>
<div id="attachment_295" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-295 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/423652_10150751156228289_678288288_12424689_917070934_n.jpg" alt="Car Ferry Going to the Isle of Mujeres" width="960" height="636" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Car Ferry to the Island, $2</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><strong>Transportation To The Island</strong></p>
<p>There are three options to get to the island: a car ferry or the two faster paced people ferries. The car ferry left less than a mile from our resort and was only two dollars each way. To take a cab there from the hotel zone is about $15. If you are already in the hotel zone take one of the faster ferries which leave more often. The Magana Express leaves from Puerto Jaurez and the UltraMar from Gran Puerto which will be about eight dollars each way. The car ferry is very slow and can take up to an hour just to load. Be prepared to see anything from motorcycles to pigs pile on. The people ferries are fancier affairs and offer live music and a bar. Once on the water the car ferry takes about 45 minutes to get to the island and the people ferries only take fifteen minutes.</p>
<div id="attachment_308" style="width: 646px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-308 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/395189_10150751169923289_678288288_12424761_754987436_n1.jpg" alt="Cement Truck Loading onthe Car Ferry to the Isle of Mujeres" width="636" height="960" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A Cement Truck Loads on the Car Ferry</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><strong>Transportation On the Island</strong></p>
<p>Once on the island you can rent a golf cart for $50 for an entire day. There are also moped options which are cheaper and can carry two people. It is suggested that you be extra careful because of speed bumps all over the island and the crazy driving! We choose to rent a golf cart for the day and really enjoyed exploring the island. It never hurts to try to get the cost down of the golf cart or moped rental. I believe we only paid $47 for the day because we mentioned we would look elsewhere. Some golf carts carry two people, others that are more expensive carry four. Gas is included.</p>
<div id="attachment_309" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-309 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/407128_10150751170948289_678288288_12424771_381805585_n.jpg" alt="Departing to the Isle of Mujeres on a Car Ferry" width="960" height="636" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Leaving for the Island on the Car Ferry</p></div>
<div id="attachment_296" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-296 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/425656_10150751173238289_678288288_12424788_1388271362_n.jpg" alt="Turtle in the Turtle Sanctuary on the Isle of Mujeres" width="960" height="636" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Turtle at the Sanctuary</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><strong>The Turtle Sanctuary/Farm</strong></p>
<p>In addition to simply driving around and enjoying the island you can stop at the Turtle Farm which holds hundreds of sea turtles of all sizes. The Isle’s Turtle Farm is a lot of fun for only $3 per person and you can purchase additional food to feed the turtles. We had fun just watching others feed the turtles and snuck into a back room which held turtles in tanks the size of a thumb! The Sanctuary helps save turtles by providing safe places for them to lay eggs. Inside are hundreds of small turtles and outside you can find the larger, older turtles. A store offers snacks and turtle souvenirs.</p>
<div id="attachment_297" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-297  " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/403825_10150751172313289_678288288_12424782_333238973_n.jpg" alt="Baby Turtles in the Turtle Sanctuary on the Isle of Mujeres" width="960" height="636" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Baby Turtle</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><strong>Punta Sur: The Cliff of Dawn</strong></p>
<p>Punta Sur is a famous destination on the Island. The easternmost part in all of Mexico, one can walk out onto the Cliff of Dawn and enjoy old Myan ruins. If you visit before the sun rises, you’ll be the first to see the sunrise in all of Mexico! (Cool in theory, but really? We aren’t the crowd to wake up and get there at that time) We paid the $3 to walk out to the cliff and got some great pictures of the crystal blue water hitting the rocks. There are trails around the cliff leading to the water and you can spend a lot of time admiring the Mexican sculpture garden. There are many shops to purchase souvenirs (which are overpriced) and a restaurant that includes a good stocked bar. Dustin and I grabbed an ice cream drum stick to beat the heat and enjoyed the many promised Iguanas that were sun bathing. There are many signs on the island that lead you to this attraction. It’s a really great thing to do on the island; just make sure you bring sunblock and lots of water to stay hydrated and beat the heat. They will charge you to use the bathroom here as well. A pro travel tip includes bringing grapes and putting them on a stick to feed the huge iguanas. They love them and will try to get them off the stick like a cat, using their claws!</p>
<div id="attachment_300" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-300 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/424430_10150751176388289_678288288_12424804_554825630_n.jpg" alt="Iguana Enjoying Grapes at Punta Sur on the Isle of Mujeres" width="960" height="636" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Iguana Enjoying Grapes on a Stick at Punta Sur</p></div>
<div id="attachment_298" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-298 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/428789_10150751176573289_678288288_12424805_678777779_n.jpg" alt="Sculptures at Punta Sur on the Isle of Mujeres" width="960" height="636" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sculptures at Punta Sur</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><strong>Restaurants On the Island</strong></p>
<p>There are many places to eat on the island. We stopped at a little restaurant on the water and both ordered veggie fajitas. The prices are kind of high because of the tourists and because it’s an island but the food was ok. It’s best to drink bottled water and always eat a place where there are a lot of people. (That way you’ll know it’s good). Some of the featured restaurants on the island include Mama Rosa&#8217;s, Buho&#8217;s, Cafe Cito, &amp; Sunset Grill.</p>
<div id="attachment_299" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-299 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/425643_10150751187908289_678288288_12424871_1365652655_n.jpg" alt="Ocean View from the Isle of Mujeres" width="960" height="636" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Water on the Island</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>MUSA </strong></p>
<p>MUSA is the world&#8217;s biggest underwater museum and is off the Island of Mujeres. Jason deCaires Taylor worked to design hundreds of sculptures with the help of marine biologists. The sculptures themselves work as artificial reefs and the designers hope they will help to deter tourists from the natural ones in the area which are damaged. You can view some of the sculptures while snorkeling but some require scuba diving to see them. The largest piece, known as Silent Evolution, features over 400 life sized human figures.</p>
<div id="attachment_302" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-302 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/408956_10150751168893289_678288288_12424755_1978599054_n.jpg" alt="Clear Water Near the Isle of Mujeres" width="960" height="636" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Clear Water for Snorkeling/Scuba Diving</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Scuba Diving &amp; Snorkeling  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are very many companies that host scuba diving and snorkeling off the island. Although we didn&#8217;t go snorkeling (we ran out of time) we enjoyed learning about all the opportunities on the Island and would like to go back. Isle Dive Guide.com offers a great overview about diving in the area and some of the notable diving companies include Sea Hawk Divers, Mundaca Divers, Cruise Divers, and the Carey Dive Center. The Cave of Sleeping Sharks was discovered by Carlos Garcia Castillo about 50 years ago. You can discover the cave, 65 feet under water, where sharks go to sleep but don&#8217;t come out for awhile according to the story. Garrafon National Reef Park is also a great place to snorkel. There are great natural reef formations and snorkel guide tours. Again, we didn&#8217;t get to experience this part of the island&#8217;s atmosphere but enjoyed our time there nonetheless.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Swimming with Dolphins </strong></p>
<p> Swimming with dolphins is a wonderful opportunity on the Island of Mujeres if you have the budget for it. Dolphins can hug, high five and even offer kisses and The Dolphin Discovery at Garrafon National Park. At about $130 per person depending on the package this is an activity that costs but may be worth it to get a dolphin hug. Even if you don&#8217;t get to experience this; you&#8217;ll still enjoy the island.</p>
<div id="attachment_310" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-310 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/427461_10150751177398289_678288288_12424811_1286459955_n2.jpg" alt="Myan Ruins at Punta Sur on the Isle of Mujeres" width="960" height="636" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Myan Ruins at Punta Sur</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Other Activities</strong></p>
<p> Other activities on the island include whale shark tours, scuba diving at ship wrecks, and yoga classes. Not for the easily skirmish, for about $100 you can swim with the largest shark in the world, the whale shark! This activity is dependent on the season but can be a great one that includes an authentic lunch. Scuba diving at local ship wrecks involves certification and much planning. It&#8217;s not for the typical traveler. Yoga classes are many and is embraced on the island. Simply look up yoga and the Isle of Mujeres to find an instructor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_311" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-311  " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/426223_10150751188103289_678288288_12424872_993108698_n.jpg" alt="Sunburned and Driving on the Isle of Mujeres" width="960" height="636" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dustin Sunburned and Driving Around the Island</p></div>
<p>In conclusion for a small island there&#8217;s a ton to do on the Island of Mujeres. Keep your adventure sense strong and jump out of your comfort to meet locals and snap pictures with huge iguanas. In addition to a day visit you can choose to stay overnight on the island. Perhaps I&#8217;ll write more about that later but for now I think you have plenty to look forward to!</p>
<div id="attachment_312" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-312 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/430800_10150751188393289_678288288_12424874_1312404054_n.jpg" alt="Driving around the Isle of Mujeres" width="960" height="636" /><p class="wp-caption-text">It&#39;s Us Driving on the Island</p></div>

<div id="attachment_87" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-87  " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/426730_10150751146188289_678288288_12424616_1246028420_n-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" /><p class="wp-caption-text">View from our room</p></div>
<p>In the southern region of Cancun one can find the unfinished five star resort Playa Del Palmar. Hovering over the Caribbean facing the Isle of Mujeres, the ten story resort adds a dash of color to the blue sky with brown and burnt orange rooms and outward accents. Through a wonderful deal offered by LivingSoical.com my husband and I found ourselves here from January 16th to the 21st for some much needed R &amp; R.</p>
<p>Before heading out I obsessively checked Travel Advisor to hear numerous stories of awful service and less than spectacular beaches and food. After purchasing the voucher there wasn’t anything to do but move forward with the vacation and hope for the best while purchasing plane tickets to Cancun. Although the service was sometimes slow at the snack bar and restaurants overall we were satisfied with the resort.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Arrival To Cancun</strong></p>
<p>To our surprise the vacation ended up going off without a hitch-beginning with the private airport transfer to our resort (complete with AC and a welcoming chauffeur). As I remembered our trip previously to Cancun I frowned as we walked through the receiving terminal filled with time share representatives and cab owners yelling and persuading you to come to their booths or take an undesired tour. Immediately my eyes distinguished a sign with our names on it through the crowd and grabbing Dustin’s arm we were off to our private cab ride.</p>
<div id="attachment_97" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-97  " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/393819_10150751168053289_678288288_12424749_1303140562_n-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Me with Playa Del Palmer in the Background</p></div>
<p>Playa Del Palmar Resort and Spa is about twenty to thirty minutes away from the Cancun International Airport and is one of the southern furthest resorts in Cancun before Playa Del Carmen. A row of recently built street lamps and paved roads lead to the resort and as our chauffeur explained since the building up of the southern Cancun hotels crime and poverty levels have plummeted.</p>
<div id="attachment_88" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-88  " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/403654_10150751149278289_678288288_12424637_1761219482_n-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Our Living Room in the Villa</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Arrival To Playa Del Palmar </strong></p>
<p>Once arriving at the brand new resort we were greeted warmly with fruit cocktails and itineraries for our stay. Even after living in Ohio for the most of four months we still felt the stress of the huge city of Chicago and booked a couples massage at The Village Spa. In addition to the luxurious massages we also took advantage of the recommended restaurant, Zama.</p>
<p>After the initial greetings and sign-in we were escorted to our Villa. I had seen many pictures before but was floored when our host opened the door and my eyes landed on the Caribbean from every angle of the condo! Each private villa comes with a huge balcony and ours was on the eighth floor with a perfect view of the resort and ocean. In addition to marble flooring, huge TV’s in every room, two bathrooms and a full kitchen we found our fridge to be stocked with chips, Snicker bars, beers, and pop!</p>
<div id="attachment_89" style="width: 208px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-89  " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/424133_10150751190713289_1992261007_n1-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Balcony of Villa with Hammock</p></div>
<p>The two person jacuzzi and double sink bathroom with rain shower almost sold us until we noticed the full hammock hanging out on the balcony off the master bedroom. (Cha Ching!) Although this condo could’ve held up to five adults, we enjoyed the space ourselves and made sure to “spread out”. (Also known as claiming areas to throw our junk and marking our bed territory) At home in the states we don’t invest in cable and only have a Roku player with Netflicks so the 60+ inch flat screen with cable made for a really happy husband. I’m pretty sure we watched National Geographic and Ancient Aliens the entire time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Village Spa </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Village Spa at the Playa Del Plamar is heavenly. Although I had been to spas on cruises and in the States I hadn’t enjoyed a full body massage in a tropical location. The Spa itself is set below ground level in what looks like a village. Each hut holds private rooms with showers and you can hear the massive man made waterfall in the background. Upon arriving you will be offered green iced tea and many different types of fruit. Women and men are escorted into different locker rooms and given spa robes, towels, and sandals. The women’s locker room offered lotions, hair accessories, and even a scale for convenience. To begin the spa journey you are instructed to shower and return to the lobby for the steam room. The steam room is repeatedly filled with steam on a timer and I had to continually lift my feet because it was so hot! You are welcome to enjoy your tea in the steam room and stay for a total of ten minutes. The next step in the process if horrendous. There is a freezing cold tub that you are to dunk in for a few seconds. After the freezing cold pool you are to get into a hot tub for five minutes then jump back into the freezing cold pool. This process if supposed to help your energy levels, metabolism, and cleanse the body.</p>
<div id="attachment_90" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-90  " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/423131_10150751146598289_678288288_12424618_853823236_n1-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Village Spa</p></div>
<p>On conclusion of the hot/cold water therapy you are instructed to get in your birthday suit and grab a robe. For those who are a little more modest than myself and my better half (we loved the naked part!) you can also bring your undies. There is a cold cloth placed over your nose with citrus oils until you are called back for your massage.</p>
<p>50 minutes of a whole body Swedish massage and I was in heaven. The masseuses at The Village Spa paid close attention to any tense areas we informed them ahead about and also gave us plenty of privacy while dropping the robes. At $100 for 50 minutes I would say the massage was well worth it but to be honest it was included in our package! Afterwards Dustin and I were walking on clouds and hated to leave but it was off to dinner.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Activities at Playa Del Palmar </strong></p>
<p>We didn’t over-plan this vacation and lounged on the beach all day and sometimes rested in the many hot tubs (one of which had a fire pit in the middle). I think I drank a few too many Dirty Monkeys (recipe to follow) and learned that I’m a huge fan of strawberry tequila while Dustin braved the same but cayenne pepper infused.</p>
<div id="attachment_91" style="width: 208px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-91  " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/418454_10150751157283289_678288288_12424699_281564836_n-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dustin Swinging At the Beachside Bar</p></div>
<p>One of our favorite parts of the resort was the swinging bar. The beach bar actually had swings that you could swing on while enjoying your favorite drink. We watched people, made friends with the bartenders, and took time to just catch our breath here on the beach. The resort also had a huge snack bar with chicken fajitas, nachos, burgers, and sandwiches. Since our package was all inclusive we made use of the snack bars and restaurants all the time. We also fell in love with receiving room service every morning-ordering fruit plates, coffee, and made to order omelets which we enjoyed on the balcony.  The restaurants were good but not great. I took advantage of the all inclusive and ordered calamari, appetizers, and shrimp while Dustin enjoyed steak. In the evening you had to make reservations at different restaurants and we ate at each one: Zama, Davino, and La Casona. Zama was American and Latino inspired while Davino offered Mediterranean fare and Itallian. La Casona was a steak house and I really enjoyed the shrimp curry and apple dessert.</p>
<p>On a few of the nights the resort offered entertainment. Our favorite show was a show on the beach simply called the Fire Show. This show included belly dancers and fire lickers. The drums on the beach added to the beauty that was fire dancing and we stayed up later than usual just to finish the show. I had never seen fire dancers jump lit ropes or belly dancers hoola hoop with flames. It was splendid. Each night there was live music at the restaurants and we made friends with a band from Cuba called Sante Fe. On many occasions they serenaded us (for a few bucks) and asked if we were honeymooners. Mexican Fiesta night was fun and there was free tequila and a band. Authentic Mexican food could be sampled and we enjoyed the dancing set of the performance. Although we didn&#8217;t utilize other activities the resort offered Yoga, water aerobics, paddle boating, and sea kayaking. There was an option for $60 a person to go into the clubs downtown Cancun but we passed and enjoyed the free alcohol and alone time at the resort itself.</p>

<p>In conclusion we had a blast! I would recommend the resort and the time we spent there was very relaxing. We purchased the &#8220;escape&#8221; from Livingsocial.com in their escapes section for around $900 which included our private hotel transfer, food, fridge stock, most tips, alcohol, massages and free wifi. If we didn&#8217;t use the livingsocial coupon our trip would&#8217;ve been over $3,000. I don&#8217;t think I would recommend the resort for the later price. If you&#8217;re looking for a higher energy resort this place isn&#8217;t for you. Sleeping, reading, resting, and swinging in a hammock was all that this place consisted of and was good at it! In the end we only spent $60 at the resort itself. ($20 for massage tips, $20 for sunblock &amp; $20 on tips) Tips were included but we choose to tip additionally. We choose to bring carry on luggage only so we purchased sun block at the resort shop. This was a big mistake but still saved us money since most airlines charge $25-$50 a checked bag and later our we missed a flight out of D.C.</p>
<p>Our favorite part of the trip had to have been our day trip to the Isle of Mujeres, a small island off the east coast of Mexico. I&#8217;ve written a lot and will dedicate another article to our amazing and high energy trip there!</p>
