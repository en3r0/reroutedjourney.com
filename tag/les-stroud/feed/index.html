				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi friends. A HUGE request that would really help us here at ReroutedJourney.com.</p>
<p>I have been writing about my travel experiences since I was old enough to hold a compass. There is an <strong>amazing opportunity</strong> to get my writing recognized and win us a trip to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD</span></strong> for 4 people (including airfare). Intrepid travel is holding a competition for those who consider themselves intrepid travelers. (intrepid means fearless) I have submitted a written story of my time serving in Africa.</p>
<p>Dustin and I are almost obsessive with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Stroud" target="_blank">The One and Only Les Stroud</a> who happens to be one of the judges. Les tackles the outdoors like nobody&#8217;s business but our favorite aspect of his travel is a series called Beyond Survival that encourages the protection of dying people groups around the world. (I could go on and on about how amazing and culturally competent he is &#8230;) Other judges include Charley Boorman, Pauline Frommer, and and Felicity Harley. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If my entry is in the top ten it will be reviewed by these amazing travelers. </span></strong> Since this is based on VOTES. It&#8217;s up to you to help me win. Please take a few minutes out of your day and vote for my entry. (You can only vote once so you&#8217;re off the hook about voting again and again or at a specific time)</p>
<h2><a href="http://iamintrepid.intrepidtravel.com/entries/show/id/703" target="_blank">You can vote for and read my entry here! </a></h2>
<p>If I&#8217;m blessed to win, Dustin and I plan on using the opportunity to visit the states and come home for Christmas once while traveling in India or to continue to travel and serve.</p>
