<h2 dir="ltr">Valentine’s Day was extra special this year.<b><b> </b></b></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Our good friend Lindsey decided to get tattooed with us by Ali McGregor from <a href="http://www.capcitytattooco.com/" target="_blank">Cap City Tattoo</a>. Lindsey was inked with a beautiful tribute to our good friend Jon Pound who passed away two years ago from cancer. He had always dreamed of going to India and loved books about Ghandi and Mother Teresa. He had the word “Hope” in Hindi tattooed above his chemotherapy port. A lot of our friends and his family members have gotten the same tattoo as a tribute to him and his calling. Lindsey helped design the lettering and had the tattoo done above her heart. A group of friends and us came to support her. Chris, surprised everyone by taking off her sweatshirt to reveal a t-shirt with Jon’s face on it! We all laughed and cried a little as we remembered our good friend. Among all who were there was: Spencer, Chris and Kenzie, Lindsey and Dustin and I.</p>

<h2>My Vintage Frame</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Inspired by a white-board, and empty frame&#8230;I got an antique frame with the word “empathy” tattooed on my left wrist. God is constantly bringing people to my mind to pray for and I am always scribbling with sharpies (I have the 80’s inspired set) on my arm. Now that I have a blank frame, I can place people’s names or other types of words and concepts to meditate on, on my wrist. I’ve already had many names, quotes, and Bible verses written in my perfect frame. This tattoo was extremely painful and probably the worst one I’ve gotten. The traditional banner hits my wrist bone on both sides and the nerve endings hurt like crazy. I braved it out though and Alli, our artist, even called me her “brave little soldier.” (for the record, I didn’t cry!)</p>
<h2> The Compass</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Dustin continued to work on his “nautical themed arm” and got a beautiful compass on his forearm. I think it’s really awesome and it flows really well with the shape of his arm. He said it didn’t hurt at all and really enjoyed getting it done. His next tattoo will probably be of a gigantic ship as soon as we have the money to invest.</p>
<h2> Our Date</h2>
<p dir="ltr">After grabbing a delicious lunch of butternut squash soup and chicken salad on a croissant from What’s For Dessert, we headed to C-bus with coffee in tow. We listened to great music and we were excited to hang out with our friends at the tattoo studio. Once there we all took turns running over to the coffee house across the street in the historic district of Columbus and grabbed lattes and Cliff bars. After eight hours there, Dustin and I were ready to eat. We drove to Easton Town Center and I got to go to my all time favorite store: <a href="http://www.lushusa.com/" target="_blank">LUSH Cosmetics</a>. (More on them later). I purchased some bath bombs and natural deodorant and then we were seated at <a href="http://www.pfchangs.com/index.aspx" target="_blank">P.F. Changs</a> for a late dinner. Our waiter noticed the familiar black-trash-bag-like wraps on our arms and asked about our tattoos. We decided to have a go at the Prixe Fix Menu which included two entrees, an appetizer, two soups, and two desserts. We devoured the lettuce wraps and sipped the soup. We ordered sweet and sour chicken and a spicy chicken dish and shared, reaching over each other’s plates. After eating so much, we asked for our dessert to go and after getting home and taking a bubble bath with my new bath bomb I layed in the bed and ate my tiramisu! Honestly, this Valentine’s Day was one of the BEST and I was so excited to spend time with the love of my life and some of our dearest friends. So many people forget to celebrate love and relationships everyday and it was a great time to step back and reflect on how fortunate we are to have each other and other amazing humans in our lives.</p>

<p>It began in middle school, really. I remember looking around the home class and staring at every other girls’ hair, outfit, and painted faces. Comparing myself to the countless <a href="http://www.painetworks.com/photos/gu/gu2181.JPG" target="_blank">blue-shadowed adversaries</a> I found I was lacking in everything. How could I grab Andrew’s attention, (the top basketball/football player with gorgeous blue eyes and witty humor) without spending hours straightening, plucking, purchasing, and investing in my looks? Why didn’t my hair straighten like Susans? Couldn’t I stop biting my nails like Karen? What about Carrie’s nice clothes from Aéropostale? I had to own an American Eagle pair of clogs or else I’d just die (as I explained with passion to my mother).</p>
<p>After many years of struggling with self-worth and finding pride in my appearance, I’ve learned to love myself. I’m not happy dressing and looking like every other girl. I love myself now with grace, love, and a lot of empathy. I wear what I want and enjoy artistic expression through the way I dress and do my hair and makeup. I take pride in my body modifications and enjoy challenging the status quo. Can a “good” person have tattoos? You bet. Can a “Christian” woman take great care of herself and look beautiful? Of course.</p>

<h2>Who I Am Now</h2>
<p>Now, ten years later I’ve grown and have become what I never wanted to be: myself. Tiffany. I have beautiful blue eyes that change shades depending on my emotions, my hair is uncontrollably curly but has learned to love me back with a little care and attention. My nails grow strong and love the color blue on them, my lips are full and I can easily pull off full bodied dresses and skirts with my womanly hips. I also have acne scarring that reminds me of the countless trips to the dermatologist, some stretch marks that I’d rather not flaunt, and some extra pounds in the midsection. Overall, I see myself as my best friend. A girl that’s lived a long, hard but blessed life that will be there for you in an instant and can emphasize with conviction most life issues.</p>
<h2>My Hair</h2>
<p>So this brings me to my hair. I adore my hair. My hair is a way for me to hide some scarring on my right temple from acne and also helps to distract from my chubbier chin (or so I think in my mind). My hair has become a love of mine and I take care of it like a mother. I invest in great haircuts and spend a lot of time conditioning it and using organic products. I’ve spent many years perfecting the art of my locks and I beam when anyone compliments me on them, especially Dustin. When I am feeling fat or rather ugly I always combat these thoughts by assuring myself; at least I have pretty hair. I tie my identity as a woman to my long curls and cannot even comprehend myself with short hair.</p>
<div id="attachment_535" style="width: 198px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-535  " title="long hair picture" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/6140_158471948288_678288288_3438270_3464413_n-188x300.jpg" alt="Tiffany's Long Hair" width="188" height="300" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/6140_158471948288_678288288_3438270_3464413_n-188x300.jpg 188w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/6140_158471948288_678288288_3438270_3464413_n.jpeg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Curly Hair Porn</p></div>
<p>This is why I am cutting my hair off for India.</p>
<p>In some way, whether intentionally or unaware I’ve placed a lot of my self-worth into my hair. How? I’m not sure but I know that our process of traveling and serving in India is an act of selflessness and I want to transform my posture to one of humility. In some ways I will be free and forced to live face forward, without hiding behind long hair or a styled look.</p>
<p>So, will I cry when the big chop comes? Probably. Will I hold the ponytail and rub it against my face and keep it by my bed for months? Creepy&#8230; No.</p>
<p>I’m donating my hair to <a href="http://www.locksoflove.org/" target="_blank">Locks of Love</a>, an awesome organization that uses donated hair to make wigs for economically disadvantaged children that have long term illnesses that results in hair loss. If you haven’t heard of the organization, where the heck have you been? It’s a great organization that’s been around for years. You can stay tuned for the big day that has yet to be determined. If you can’t wait until then have fun looking at <a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/196_506702282992_59102828_30672536_5360_n.jpeg" target="_blank">this photo</a> of when Dustin and his good friend Brice shaved their heads to donate to Locks of Love a few years back. P.S. Dustin’s bare head does indeed look like the moon. Hence, he won’t be shaving his head for India.</p>
<p>Until then, I’m enjoying my long locks and intentionally leaving the windows down for some wind-blown attractiveness.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting another tattoo for awhile before leaving for India in July. It just so happened that I was sick for Valentine&#8217;s Day so I asked Dustin if I could get a tattoo instead of a romantic date. He obliged and before I knew it we were both at Cap City Tattoo in the Historic Old Towne of Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<div id="attachment_194" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-194 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Photo-on-2012-02-21-at-20.02-2.jpg" alt="Me Being Happy" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Me, happy with my tattoo</p></div>
<p>Cap City Tattoo is owned by Ali Macgregor, an awesome artist who has been featured in a ton of magazines and is one of very few tattoo shop owners. After hanging out at a local coffee shop with our friends Chris and Kenzie she drew up a great tattoo based off my references and soon I was under the gun. Her design was custom and included two flowers, and three leaves with a graphic element. I didn&#8217;t want the tattoo to look &#8220;realistic&#8221; but wanted it to look like someone just took a sharpie and drew flowers on my forearm. After talking with Ali we decided to have some shading around the inside of the flowers as you can see in the picture.</p>
<div id="attachment_195" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-195 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Photo-on-2012-02-21-at-20.01.jpg" alt="Art Nouveau Floral Tattoo" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Art Nouveau Floral</p></div>
<p>The tattoo itself took a little over an hour and was really painless which was surprising because of the placement. Although the tattoo didn&#8217;t hold a ton of meaning (I&#8217;m not big on meaningful, emotional tattoos) I am excited that it can/will represent my bond with my sister and my mum while I&#8217;m away in India, Thailand, and Cambodia. Whenever I look down I can remember that I have family in the states and that our love and genuine fondness of one another will help me through tough times when I&#8217;m away.</p>
<div id="attachment_196" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-196 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Photo-on-2012-02-21-at-20.02.jpg" alt="Art Nouveau Floral Tattoo Close Up" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Close Up: Still Healing</p></div>
<p>Dustin also got a tattoo that was smaller on his wrist that says the word &#8220;Action.&#8221; This correlates with his &#8220;Faith&#8221; tattoo because actions without faith is meaningless and vice versa. An artist named Phill DeAngulo did his and rocked it out. You can check out Cap City Tattoo <a href="http://www.capcitytattooco.com/alli-macgregor.html" target="_blank">here</a> and show them some love. If you&#8217;re in the area also grab some coffee at the shop across the street. They roast their own beans and have a killer caramel latte.</p>
