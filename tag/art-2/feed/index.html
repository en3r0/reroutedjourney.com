				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-933" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-5.jpg" alt="unnamed-5" width="267" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>July 30th marked our four year anniversary. It&#8217;s pretty hard to believe I&#8217;ve been a MRS for that long! As usual, we decided to go on a mini-adventure to celebrate. I organized a fun trip that included museums and yummy food on the cheap. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of what we did:</p>
<div id="attachment_931" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-1.jpg" alt="unnamed-1" width="150" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Driving up to Cleveland</p></div>
<p>On Saturday, August 9th we took our time waking up and packed. We left for Cleveland around 11:00am. Our first stop was a restaurant known for one thing: it&#8217;s massive grilled cheeses! <a href="http://meltbarandgrilled.com/" target="_blank">Melt Bar and Grilled</a> is a cheese lovers dream-come-true! Humongous sandwiches are packed with things like: pork belly, lasagna, crispy battered chicken, homemade meatballs and eggplant. The menu alone will take you at least twenty minutes to look over. Since we were going to visit the <a href="http://www.clevelandart.org/" target="_blank">Cleveland Museum of Art</a>, we stopped in at the location in Cleveland Heights.</p>
<div id="attachment_932" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed.jpg"><img class="wp-image-932" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="150" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Driving selfie</p></div>
<p>As we walked inside, we knew we would love every minute of it. Kitchy light up santa clauses and Easter rabbits were on display with exposed brick and vintage Dairy Queen signs. The menus were plastered onto old record covers. There was a large bar and plenty of people. We couldn&#8217;t help but giggle at a super hipster couple who not only had matching glasses but had matching hats. I looked around and couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes: the grilled cheeses were the biggest I&#8217;d ever seen! HUGE. LARGE. GIGANTIC. The portions were enough to share with 2-3 people. Dustin and I couldn&#8217;t decide on a sandwich to share so we each went out own way.</p>
<p>I ordered the Mushroom Melt which included garlic mushrooms, caramel port onions, arugula and provolone. Dustin went kinda crazy and ordered the Caribbean Jerk War Pig which had jerk spiced pulled pork and seared pork belly, mango habanero chutney, caribbean slaw, fried sweet plantains and pepper jack cheese. Each sandwich came with a large order of fries. Dustin couldn&#8217;t finish his and I finished mine but couldn&#8217;t take on the fries. (Mine was a little smaller). Instead of ordering a beer we opted for a handcrafted soda. Delicious. The sandwiches were $11-13. Not bad for the amount of food and atmosphere.</p>
<div id="attachment_934" style="width: 277px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-934" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-2.jpg" alt="unnamed-2" width="267" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Inside Melt</p></div>
<div id="attachment_935" style="width: 277px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-4.jpg"><img class="wp-image-935" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-4.jpg" alt="unnamed-4" width="267" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The opposite side of the menus</p></div>

<div id="attachment_937" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-6.jpg"><img class="wp-image-937" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-6.jpg" alt="unnamed-6" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">If you get a tattoo with the logo, you&#8217;ll get 25% off for life!</p></div>
<div id="attachment_938" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-9.jpg"><img class="wp-image-938" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-9.jpg" alt="unnamed-9" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dustin needed muscle to attack the sandwich</p></div>
<p>After hitting Melt, we drive about six minutes to the Cleveland Museum of Art. The museum is excellent and is absolutely free! One of the ways we saved money was that we parked on the street. We drove around and found metered parking which was less than $1 for about an hour and a half. We walked a little bit, but not too bad. The parking at the museum is $8. Exploring the museum was fun. They have a really cool knights exhibit with armor and weapons. Dustin and I really loved seeing the Christian pieces and the modern art section. There were furniture pieces from Frank Lloyd Wright and paintings by Monet. Very educational and really fun! Oh, and did I say free?</p>
<div id="attachment_940" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-3.jpg"><img class="wp-image-940" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-3.jpg" alt="unnamed-3" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A royal chair at the museum</p></div>
<div id="attachment_939" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-8.jpg"><img class="wp-image-939" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-8.jpg" alt="unnamed-8" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Us at the museum taking a break</p></div>
<div id="attachment_941" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-11.jpg"><img class="wp-image-941" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-11.jpg" alt="unnamed-11" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An exhibit</p></div>
<p>For this portion of the trip we spent money on  the lunch and parking. Our lunch was $25 without tip. (2 meals and a drink to share) If we had had a refrigerator it could have easily fed us twice! The parking was $1. After we went to the museum, we checked into our hotel downtown and took a nap!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;m preparing for India I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about photography and our new Nikon. In attempt to smother it with the love akin to a first-born-male-child-in China (or the like) I&#8217;ve found a few photography purchases to contemplate. Now, as you know I&#8217;m trying to be a responsible adult and not purchase cute, un-needed items in slew of our trip to India BUT I couldn&#8217;t help but <del>lust after</del> share the following items.</p>
<div id="attachment_288" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/camera-cookie-cutters/"><img class="size-full wp-image-288 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/camera-cookie-cutters-45ee_600.0000001323072972.jpg" alt="Camera Cookie Cutter Set" width="600" height="399" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Camera Cookie Cutter Set</p></div>
<p>I can imagine myself in the cutest Anthropologie apron baking these adorable cookies and sharing them with our hip-photography loving neighbors. Included in the set is an SLR, a classic range finder and a twin reflex camera. For only $18 and a life supply of picture-worthy cookies; I&#8217;d shutter imagining NOT having them in my domesticated life.</p>
<div id="attachment_290" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.artatheart.co.uk/artatheart/2011/09/i-felt-photogenic-camera-case.html"><img class="size-full wp-image-290 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/6a011571d8bb99970b015434f6fe8a970c-800wi.jpg" alt="Felt Camera Case" width="550" height="503" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I Felt Photogenic Camera Case</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mod Cloth always has the very best purses and accessories. When I came upon this beautiful camera case I about ran out and bought a camera to fit in the case! Later it dawned on me that this cute, retro case could also be used to hold accessories and other much-loved electronics.</p>
<div id="attachment_291" style="width: 453px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://microsites.lomography.com/diana/"><img class=" wp-image-291  " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/transition03.jpg" alt="Diana F+ Camera" width="443" height="348" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Diana F+</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mad love to the cult-favorite Diana F+. After receiving a beautiful light blue one as a Christmas gift I still haven&#8217;t purchased the film which is about $25 a roll. I&#8217;m dying to get out and take some cool lomo-shots and will just have to bite the bullet and cough up the change for the expensive film. If you haven&#8217;t heard of lomography check it out and let me know your thoughts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting another tattoo for awhile before leaving for India in July. It just so happened that I was sick for Valentine&#8217;s Day so I asked Dustin if I could get a tattoo instead of a romantic date. He obliged and before I knew it we were both at Cap City Tattoo in the Historic Old Towne of Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<div id="attachment_194" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-194 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Photo-on-2012-02-21-at-20.02-2.jpg" alt="Me Being Happy" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Me, happy with my tattoo</p></div>
<p>Cap City Tattoo is owned by Ali Macgregor, an awesome artist who has been featured in a ton of magazines and is one of very few tattoo shop owners. After hanging out at a local coffee shop with our friends Chris and Kenzie she drew up a great tattoo based off my references and soon I was under the gun. Her design was custom and included two flowers, and three leaves with a graphic element. I didn&#8217;t want the tattoo to look &#8220;realistic&#8221; but wanted it to look like someone just took a sharpie and drew flowers on my forearm. After talking with Ali we decided to have some shading around the inside of the flowers as you can see in the picture.</p>
<div id="attachment_195" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-195 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Photo-on-2012-02-21-at-20.01.jpg" alt="Art Nouveau Floral Tattoo" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Art Nouveau Floral</p></div>
<p>The tattoo itself took a little over an hour and was really painless which was surprising because of the placement. Although the tattoo didn&#8217;t hold a ton of meaning (I&#8217;m not big on meaningful, emotional tattoos) I am excited that it can/will represent my bond with my sister and my mum while I&#8217;m away in India, Thailand, and Cambodia. Whenever I look down I can remember that I have family in the states and that our love and genuine fondness of one another will help me through tough times when I&#8217;m away.</p>
<div id="attachment_196" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-196 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Photo-on-2012-02-21-at-20.02.jpg" alt="Art Nouveau Floral Tattoo Close Up" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Close Up: Still Healing</p></div>
<p>Dustin also got a tattoo that was smaller on his wrist that says the word &#8220;Action.&#8221; This correlates with his &#8220;Faith&#8221; tattoo because actions without faith is meaningless and vice versa. An artist named Phill DeAngulo did his and rocked it out. You can check out Cap City Tattoo <a href="http://www.capcitytattooco.com/alli-macgregor.html" target="_blank">here</a> and show them some love. If you&#8217;re in the area also grab some coffee at the shop across the street. They roast their own beans and have a killer caramel latte.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Khara Ledonne switches from painting huge scale murals to teeny tiny lockets. I first fell in love with her whimsical lockets about the size of a traditional marble in Lincoln Square in Chicago at a small art store called <a href="http://www.sacredartstore.com/">Sacred Art</a>. One of my friends Lisa is the Curator there. I gasped and opened all of the tiny lockets revealing some of the coolest illustrations I’ve seen in awhile. Of course I begged Dustin for one because 1. it was creative jewelry 2. she hand paints the cute lockets! Somehow the beautiful lockets didn’t shake from my memory in December and I casually mentioned one as a Christmas list wish. To my surprise Dustin tracked the locket down and had one custom ordered for me with a kite painted inside.</p>
<p>It is so beautiful and I couldn’t help but research the artist and post about it here! Not only is the locket beautiful, it comes in a very cute altoid-like box (mine had birds on it) to keep it safe in. Khara has done some amazing works both tiny and large. She said “Enormous, created worlds, and teeny, created worlds are endlessly engaging for me.  Someday I’ll build a house and really go nuts.” on her website. What an artist after my own heart! Check her out <a href="http://kharaledonne.com/">here</a> and on etsy <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/kharaledonne">here</a> to purchase her lockets. You won’t regret it!</p>
