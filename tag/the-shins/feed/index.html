				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s late. I know. Summer was a really tough time for us as I was sick for all of it and when we did things it was a painful experience so I didn&#8217;t feel like writing or blogging about them. The pain is but a memory and as I recover I&#8217;m being brave and looking back on the days that were the <a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/darkness/">darkest</a>. Jesus somehow remains faithful and offers glimpses of hope even in the valley of death. Among being in the hospital a ton and not being able to get out of bed most days we did do some fun activities this summer. Dustin bought my concert tickets to <a href="http://shinstagram.theshins.com/">The Shins</a>, my favorite band and we went to the <a href="http://asian-festival.org/">Asian Festival</a> in Columbus with some of our friends, Marlaina and Richard. We also managed to get some HUGE ice cream cones at a country store. Enjoy!</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t bring our SLR to the concert but Kayley took this photo of The Shins with her Iphone.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-725" title="Sisters at Pei Wei " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0224.jpg" alt="Sisters at Pei Wei" width="614" height="461" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0224.jpg 1024w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0224-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></p>
<p>Kayley, my sister and I eating before the concert. Pei Wei was one of favorite places to eat in Columbus. It&#8217;s an asian restaurant owned by P.F. Changs, another one of favorite places (but pricer).</p>

<p>Kayley, I, and Dustin waiting for the concert to begin. It was freezing! So glad we brought coats.</p>

<p>We lived with our parents for awhile while I was sick. My mums dogs (Meeko and Snickers) loved to cuddle and take naps.</p>
<p>Even though the summer was hard: physically, emotionally, and spiritually&#8230;Jesus reigned and these pictures show joy.</p>
