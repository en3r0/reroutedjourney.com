		<description><![CDATA[Of course you made the list twice! You guys seriously MADE our trip ;) 

Thanks for liking the dress...I wanted to rock heels but there&#039;s no way I could go out all night without tripping and/or killing myself! Insert flat, comfy black boots! 

The photo was taken at a cool loungey-type place called MIX at our hotel. They have great views of the city. I know they have cocktails but I think they have soda/snacks for those who don&#039;t drink alcohol. Makes for a great (cheapish) night if you take your time downing the soda and drink in the views. It was our last night and we didn&#039;t want to walk all the way down the strip to hit Ceasars so we stayed at home!]]></description>
