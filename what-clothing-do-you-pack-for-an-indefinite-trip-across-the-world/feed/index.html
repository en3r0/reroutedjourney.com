		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much WhiteMonkey! We are very excited. How long were you able to travel in India? I will definitely take your advice and re-evaluate my list. We&#039;ve been really excited about Exofficio clothing though as of late- they have a lot of quick drying options since we&#039;ll be staying in a lot of hostels and washing clothing ourselves. Do you have a blog or any other resources about your time in India? So nice to meet you, -T]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My advice: take less! 

Turns out that every country I&#039;ve visited has a surfeit of shops selling clothing perfectly suited for the local climate, usually much cheaper than the shops &quot;at home&quot;.

A lot of your clothes were probably made in India!

Plus, carrying stuff around gets old quickly. Traveling light is soo much easier.

Good luck on your travels, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll love India. I highly recommend the narrow gauge train ride up to Shimla.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ebony- thanks so much for the advice and for commenting! I really want to up the undies to 10! haha BUT Dustin is holding his ground at 4. If I can&#039;t take having only 4 then I&#039;ll always be able to purchase more in India. I love the idea of a hoodie, have always lived in one, but need to find one that is light weight and dries quickly. Haven&#039;t found any &quot;travel hoodies&quot; that don&#039;t weigh a zillion pounds when washing by hand :( Do you know any brands that are lighter-weight? Maybe we&#039;ll open our own travel clothing company at the end of this clothing journey- one needs to be designed! Thanks for loving my writing...I&#039;ve always loved to write but now I have something to actually share. -T]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Up the undies to 5 pair! And instead of the cardigan consider a light weight hoodie that&#039;s still cute but probably more functional. Happy travels! Love your writing!]]></description>
