				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unnamed-22.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-921 alignleft" alt="unnamed-2" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unnamed-22.jpg" width="547" height="410" /></a>Our good friend is a teacher at a local high school. She&#8217;s pretty awesome and asked us to help chaperone her field trip to Columbus. Melissa has a GIGANTIC heart for kids and she&#8217;s always planning fun things for them to do. It&#8217;s difficult to get parents and relatives to come on her trips since they are during the day.</p>
<p>In comes The Montgomery&#8217;s! Since we both work from home, it&#8217;s easier for us to change our schedule around and help out (AKA working on weekends). We helped out before Christmas and got to go to a Cleveland Cavilers game. It was tiring but really informative. To begin, we take the kids to a local college and then we take them to an <a href="http://www.fcclainc.org/" target="_blank">FCCLA</a> event at the Nationwide Arena in downtown Columbus. I hadn&#8217;t heard of FCCLA until I met Melissa. It&#8217;s basically a leadership club that promotes &#8220;personal growth and leadership development through Family and Consumer Sciences education.&#8221; Melissa was a state leader for four years and enjoys being a part of the organization.</p>
<p>The event at the <a href="http://bluejackets.nhl.com/" target="_blank">Blue Jackets</a> includes having professionals come and present to the high schoolers. They are able to ask questions and learn about college. Including in the presenters were a director of marketing, a sales person, and a chef. It was very cool to hear about jobs and also to tour the stadium. We also took the students to <a href="https://www.ohiodominican.edu/" target="_blank">Ohio Dominican University</a>, a college in Columbus and they took a tour. I was excited that we got hats that said the Blue Jackets and got to go to the game! It&#8217;s really awesome that we get to help out with things like this. You fall in love with the kids and laugh a lot.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.8884979865979403">The skin on my arm felt pinched and the hospital bracelet on my left wrist plunked a few arm hairs. I bit my tongue hard, resisting the urge to curse under my breath and instead glanced around the waiting room. Dustin and I were the only one’s there and I could tell the Pain Management Office’s attempts at hospitality had failed when noticing a single carafe that hadn’t been filled since open. I imagined the coffee cold and watered down before investing energy to get up and pour myself an uninviting cup.</p>
<p>It had been four months since I had injured my neck while participating in a Zumba class and the pain hadn’t waivered, growing increasingly worse while adding tingling, numbing sensations, nausea, and blurred vision to my symptoms. When and if I could get up off the couch I had trouble walking because my muscles felt weak and I hadn’t been able to wash <a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/chopped-locks-a-donation-complete/">my foot long hair</a> in over a month by myself. We were beginning to wonder if something else was seriously wrong with me as we sat in the ER for the second time and Dustin begged the doctor to rush the MRI.</p>
<p>We were expected to be going to India in less than two months.</p>
<p>We felt God’s call early this year and had begun selling a ton of our stuff, moved back to Ohio to save money for the trip and had already purchased our plane tickets.</p>
<p>What the heck, God?</p>
<p>Why had we felt the call so strongly to dedicate our lives to sharing your hope to have the door closed in our face? Why was I suffering so much when you promised peace?</p>
<p>I yelled, cried, and fought with God about my purpose. If I wasn’t getting better (but sicker) what was I living for? Where were the plans God had promised?</p>
<p>Life became harder. Our lease was up and even though our landlords loved us, someone else was preparing to move in; we couldn’t extend our stay. Dustin had also already quit and we didn’t have insurance so we applied for COBRA, which allowed us to keep our old insurance plan but at almost $600 a month for me. God provided our amazing parents to house us and my mum, sister, and grandma packed us up. At the end of June everyone helped us move.</p>
<p>Once traveling in-between our parents I was stressed and overwhelmed. Our lives were supposed to mean more than moving back to our childhood homes&#8230;hadn’t they? Could God use us where we were at, even though we were so vulnerable?</p>
<p>If I had known that in the next few weeks I would go through narcotic withdrawal, see a neurologist, have a spinal tap, and visit the ER three times in 48 hours with the worst pain in my life, I may have given up hope of getting better. As the 16th of July came closer, our departure date for India, I seemed to get sicker. The neurologist ordered a spinal tap on the 19th of July while diagnosing me with a Pseudo Tumor Cerebri, elevated pressure of spinal fluid in the brain (after the spinal tap we found my pressure to be normal).</p>
<p>After months of hospitals, specialists, and emergency rooms and no findings we looked to other alternatives that could be causing me pain. Perhaps anxiety and my psychological health were being jeopardized? After a long night of insomnia I sobbed and admitted to Dustin that I wasn’t well&#8230;emotionally. The time in the hospitals and the strain financially hadn’t defeated me but were haunting my mind. I needed help.</p>
<p>My parents became involved and after a week transitioning in hotels to avoid the stress of being at other’s homes, Dustin made an emergency appointment with a psychiatrist. I started back on medication I had used previously to manage my anxiety and depression. As my dad sat in the hotel room and talked me out of an anxiety attack (as he always has), he explained in a calm voice that 600 million Indians were out of power and that some would inevitably die. I was in shock. Life was uneasy at home without power, what if I had been in a hospital in India? Perhaps God was protecting us here in Mansfield.</p>
<p>I’m currently on the path of recovery. After losing about fifteen pounds and memorizing the order of events in each hospital’s emergency room, I’m on my way to being myself again. Dustin and I both have trusted that God doesn’t want us in India currently but are preparing once again to leave in six months (you didn’t think we would <a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/extract-venom-snake-bite/">learn how to extract venom from a snake bite</a> for no reason). While I recover we have found a place in Mansfield near family and my doctors and have plans to work on another project about frugal urban living in a rural environment.</p>
<p>This isn’t what we wanted. This isn’t what I felt called to&#8230;but I know God has a plan for the here-and-now and we have a purpose in our hometown. God called, and put our dreams of India on hold but hasn’t and won’t hang up, even if he is silent. </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know I committed to cutting my hair and donating it to <a href="http://www.locksoflove.org/" target="_blank">Locks of Love</a> earlier in this <a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/cutting-hair/" target="_blank">post</a>. The journey was incredible and the experience fantastic. Currently I am struggling through some health issues that we have chosen not to share on Rerouted Journey (the choice to cut my hair early and lack of coverage on here was influenced by this situation). Although I don&#8217;t have the time or ability to write an entire post about getting my long locks chopped, I&#8217;ve included a picture with City Kitty to tempt you. Until then, farewell and thanks for reading.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_533" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-533" title="Tiff nose ring " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/2569_84869433288_678288288_2292367_6453449_n-300x200.jpg" alt="Tiffany with nose ring " width="300" height="200" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/2569_84869433288_678288288_2292367_6453449_n-300x200.jpg 300w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/2569_84869433288_678288288_2292367_6453449_n.jpeg 604w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rocking the nose ring</p></div>
<p>It began in middle school, really. I remember looking around the home class and staring at every other girls’ hair, outfit, and painted faces. Comparing myself to the countless <a href="http://www.painetworks.com/photos/gu/gu2181.JPG" target="_blank">blue-shadowed adversaries</a> I found I was lacking in everything. How could I grab Andrew’s attention, (the top basketball/football player with gorgeous blue eyes and witty humor) without spending hours straightening, plucking, purchasing, and investing in my looks? Why didn’t my hair straighten like Susans? Couldn’t I stop biting my nails like Karen? What about Carrie’s nice clothes from Aéropostale? I had to own an American Eagle pair of clogs or else I’d just die (as I explained with passion to my mother).</p>
<p>After many years of struggling with self-worth and finding pride in my appearance, I’ve learned to love myself. I’m not happy dressing and looking like every other girl. I love myself now with grace, love, and a lot of empathy. I wear what I want and enjoy artistic expression through the way I dress and do my hair and makeup. I take pride in my body modifications and enjoy challenging the status quo. Can a “good” person have tattoos? You bet. Can a “Christian” woman take great care of herself and look beautiful? Of course.</p>
<div id="attachment_536" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-536 " title="Yoga Pose" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/2123_73348268288_678288288_2026006_7225_n-300x251.jpg" alt="Yoga Pose Red Hair " width="300" height="251" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/2123_73348268288_678288288_2026006_7225_n-300x251.jpg 300w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/2123_73348268288_678288288_2026006_7225_n.jpeg 517w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Practicing&quot; Yoga</p></div>
<h2>Who I Am Now</h2>
<p>Now, ten years later I’ve grown and have become what I never wanted to be: myself. Tiffany. I have beautiful blue eyes that change shades depending on my emotions, my hair is uncontrollably curly but has learned to love me back with a little care and attention. My nails grow strong and love the color blue on them, my lips are full and I can easily pull off full bodied dresses and skirts with my womanly hips. I also have acne scarring that reminds me of the countless trips to the dermatologist, some stretch marks that I’d rather not flaunt, and some extra pounds in the midsection. Overall, I see myself as my best friend. A girl that’s lived a long, hard but blessed life that will be there for you in an instant and can emphasize with conviction most life issues.</p>
<h2>My Hair</h2>
<p>So this brings me to my hair. I adore my hair. My hair is a way for me to hide some scarring on my right temple from acne and also helps to distract from my chubbier chin (or so I think in my mind). My hair has become a love of mine and I take care of it like a mother. I invest in great haircuts and spend a lot of time conditioning it and using organic products. I’ve spent many years perfecting the art of my locks and I beam when anyone compliments me on them, especially Dustin. When I am feeling fat or rather ugly I always combat these thoughts by assuring myself; at least I have pretty hair. I tie my identity as a woman to my long curls and cannot even comprehend myself with short hair.</p>
<div id="attachment_535" style="width: 198px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-535  " title="long hair picture" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/6140_158471948288_678288288_3438270_3464413_n-188x300.jpg" alt="Tiffany's Long Hair" width="188" height="300" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/6140_158471948288_678288288_3438270_3464413_n-188x300.jpg 188w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/6140_158471948288_678288288_3438270_3464413_n.jpeg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Curly Hair Porn</p></div>
<p>This is why I am cutting my hair off for India.</p>
<p>In some way, whether intentionally or unaware I’ve placed a lot of my self-worth into my hair. How? I’m not sure but I know that our process of traveling and serving in India is an act of selflessness and I want to transform my posture to one of humility. In some ways I will be free and forced to live face forward, without hiding behind long hair or a styled look.</p>
<p>So, will I cry when the big chop comes? Probably. Will I hold the ponytail and rub it against my face and keep it by my bed for months? Creepy&#8230; No.</p>
<p>I’m donating my hair to <a href="http://www.locksoflove.org/" target="_blank">Locks of Love</a>, an awesome organization that uses donated hair to make wigs for economically disadvantaged children that have long term illnesses that results in hair loss. If you haven’t heard of the organization, where the heck have you been? It’s a great organization that’s been around for years. You can stay tuned for the big day that has yet to be determined. If you can’t wait until then have fun looking at <a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/196_506702282992_59102828_30672536_5360_n.jpeg" target="_blank">this photo</a> of when Dustin and his good friend Brice shaved their heads to donate to Locks of Love a few years back. P.S. Dustin’s bare head does indeed look like the moon. Hence, he won’t be shaving his head for India.</p>
<p>Until then, I’m enjoying my long locks and intentionally leaving the windows down for some wind-blown attractiveness.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-155" title="shelf and shelf" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/shelf-and-shelf-.jpg" alt="shelf and shelf" width="468" height="309" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/shelf-and-shelf-.jpg 600w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/shelf-and-shelf--300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" />Why do I have so much excessive crap around our apartment? I brew some coffee, turn on Pandora radio and attempt to empty yet another storage bin from under the bed or box to find ten more filled with similar items. Everywhere I look are odds and ends<span id="more-97"></span> we’ve picked up from shopping trips, thrift shops, and free samples. Even if we haven’t paid much for these items we have become attached to them and it’s hard to part with the smallest new note pad or scrapbooking kit. Why does Dustin need ten white V neck T’s and why in the world do I have at least four pairs of Urban Outfitters gloves? How can we strive to live simply in a culture obsessed with purchasing new shiny things?</p>
<p>Dustin and I are a part of a community group and we are currently reading <em>7: An Experimental Mutiny Against Excess</em> by the brilliant Jen Hatmaker. Throughout the book Jen focuses on radically changing different parts of her lifestyle and challenges the modern day Christian to look at their idea of the “American Dream” By focusing on different areas including: food, clothes, spending, media, possessions, waste, and stress. Focusing on these areas Jen attempts to simplify her life and allow room for God to work in and through it. As a result of studying the book Dustin and I are attempting to rid ourselves of excess possessions and have been purging our small apartment of things we don’t use, wear, or need.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-151" title="Boxes" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Boxes.jpg" alt="Boxes" width="360" height="544" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Boxes.jpg 600w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Boxes-198x300.jpg 198w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" />Ironically this week while I was enjoying my favorite magazine, Whole Living, I came across an article devoted to ridding oneself of excessiveness. Celia Barbour recounts her attempts to rid herself of sentimental items and clear her mind in the article Clutter: The Long Goodbye. Barbour explains that even though we may have space in our homes for the clutter we acquire we should be more protective of our mental space. After reading this article I found myself asking what in our home clutters our ability to invest in relationships and have a peaceful home. Is my mind cluttered because my home is?</p>
<p>This past month we have worked to get rid of unneeded items and prepare to move to India and travel the world. I’ve reluctantly donated about 100 books (<a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/giving-away-books/">watch as we build a fort for City Kitty with them</a>) and about 40 articles of clothing. Dustin has contemplated ridding himself of extra computer monitors and we’ve donated house odds and ends together including picture frames, art, and spice bowls. There are mounds of stuff just laying near the door of our one room apartment ready to find new homes.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-150 alignleft" title="Bookshelf" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Bookshelf.jpg" alt="Ikea Colorful Bookshelf" width="360" height="544" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Bookshelf.jpg 600w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Bookshelf-198x300.jpg 198w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" />Inspired by 7, our community group is preparing to have a free garage sale for those who may need some things in our city. As pointed out by our pastor; some people may feel uncomfortable taking free items. So to empower those who may benefit from our things we will hold a garage sale that is “name the price.” We’ll accept any price suggested. I’m praying every day that the items that are excessive for us may be needed and a blessing to others. As Shane Claiborne has said: the problem in the United States isn’t that people don’t care about the poor, it’s that people don’t know the poor. Through our humble garage sale we hope to personally get to know those in the community that are underprivileged and hopefully rekindle a passion within ourselves to put others first. Wow! This sounds eerily familiar-perhaps this is what Jesus did? Keep posted for more information about our material purging and our community garage sale.</p>
<h4>I want to challenge you to ask yourself:</h4>
<p>What are you holding on to material-wise that is keeping your mind cluttered?</p>
<p>Are there belongings you own that others may benefit from having?</p>
<p>Are there things in this life that are pushing/pulling you away from building real community?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest questions we’ve received while preparing to travel the world and move to India has been: why in the world India? Whether asked from well-meaning family members or shocked strangers it remains one of the biggest questions and we attempt to gracefully answer it each time.<span id="more-24"></span> If you:</p>
<p>1. have a heart for those that are the poorest among the poor</p>
<p>2. know there is more to life than the 9 to 5 cubicle life</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>3. love bright colors and chaos</p>
<p>then you may have a better understanding on why we choose India.</p>
<h2>We Are Rich; We Are Obligated To Serve the Poor</h2>
<p>Dustin and I are commanded to serve the poor as Jesus did when he was here on earth. Many have used the quote “live simply so others may simply live.” According to the Global Rich list we are in the top 1% of the richest people on the planet and that’s making little compared to others in the U.S. The website goes on further to say “three billion people live on less than $2 per day while 1.3 billion get by on less than $1 per day.” How can we fill the ever increasing gap between the poorest of the poor and the richest? Dustin and I feel the answer for us is to move to live among those struggling financially and share the wealth.</p>
<div id="attachment_27" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-27 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/the_belmont-300x200.jpg" alt="The Belmont Apartments " width="300" height="200" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/the_belmont-300x200.jpg 300w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/the_belmont.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Where we lived in Chicago</p></div>
<p>By sitting here in the U.S. watching documentaries about starving children and the AIDS epidemic we feel we aren’t doing enough within our huge, heated and cooled apartment while eating Chipotle. We desire to see India with our own eyes and share our wealth and attempt to understand what it’s like (even a little bit) to go without.</p>
<p>Here we are constantly hit with the temptation to “want more” and the line between wanting and needing has become blurred. On a recent meeting with our small group we were asked how many pairs of shoes, pants, shirts, etc. we owned. After sharing with the group we all looked around and our hearts were heavy as we remembered some in other countries don’t even own one pair of shoes.</p>
<p>So, we’re moving to India to find&#8230; well, we don’t know exactly. We will be enlightened and moved to action to serve others, that is for sure. As Jesus said it is difficult for the rich to get into heaven; let it not be us.</p>
<h3>One Becomes Wiser Through Exploring Other Cultures</h3>
<div id="attachment_28" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-28 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/africa_baby-225x300.jpg" alt="An African Baby Being Held" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/africa_baby-225x300.jpg 225w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/africa_baby.jpg 453w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Tiffany had a baby named after her during her time in Africa.</p></div>
<p>Ethnocentrism is the belief that one’s own culture is superior to all others. Americans readily accept the belief that America is better than other countries and that somehow God has blessed us to live “comfortably” in the midst of all the suffering around us. Dustin and I have choosen to live our lives against this mass belief of ethnocentrism and embrace the beauty of other nations and cultures. We believe that the best learning happens outside of the classroom and on the real field &#8211; the world. We hope to share the lessons we learn with others and hope to inspire others to step out of the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; and live as Jesus called us &#8211; with humility.</p>
<div id="attachment_29" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-29" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dustin_haiti-300x225.jpg" alt="Dustin posing with children in Haiti" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dustin_haiti-300x225.jpg 300w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dustin_haiti.jpg 604w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dustin had his goatee braided in Haiti.</p></div>
<p>India holds some of the biggest religions and varying cultures. With many people groups, historical sites, technological advances, and languages we hope to immerse ourselves into another world and learn from it. India also recognizes English as a national language and most individuals speak it fluently or know some. This will benefit us and save us time from learning a language although we plan on studying Hindi once there to better understand and relate to the people.</p>
<h3>Adventure Makes Life Fun</h3>
<p>Dustin and I love to go on adventures. When we began courting we didn’t have a lot of money (none, really) and a ton of time on our hands. We would listen to <em>The Format</em>, roll down the windows and drive around looking for adventures to be had in our small town. On many days we found ourselves exploring diners and packing picnics at the park. As we grew in our relationship and fell into the responsibilities of every day grown up life we realized there was plenty of money to have adventures but little time since we were both working full time jobs.</p>
<div id="attachment_30" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-30 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dustin_tiffany_engaged-300x199.jpg" alt="Dustin and Tiffany walking with a bike" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dustin_tiffany_engaged-300x199.jpg 300w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dustin_tiffany_engaged.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">One of out engagement pictures. In a field, on an adventure.</p></div>
<p>Our desire, through our trip to India, is to rekindle the innate longing for adventure in everyone’s hearts and prove to our generation that life doesn’t have to consist of a 9 to 5 existence in office cubicles. We expect to experience more than a handful of tales to tell as we travel and we honor the opportunity by sharing them in detail with our audience and inspiring others to embrace life’s adventures.</p>
<p>India is a land of adventure and exciting happenings. From Bollywood to the deserts of Rajasthan we are excited to explore and engage in the culture and live life a little differently while there.</p>
<h3>Jonathan Pound</h3>
<div id="attachment_31" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-31 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dustin_jon-300x213.jpg" alt="Dustin and Jon in a canoe with a tent." width="300" height="213" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dustin_jon-300x213.jpg 300w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dustin_jon.jpg 428w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Camping in Canada, Dustin and Jon had no desire to disassemble the tent to move it.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_32" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-32 " src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/jon_tattoo-300x199.jpg" alt="Jon showing his hope tattoo" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/jon_tattoo-300x199.jpg 300w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/jon_tattoo.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Jon&#8217;s only tattoo above the port. It simply says &#8220;Hope&#8221; in Hindi.</p></div>
<p style="clear: both;">This would probably be best said by Dustin but I will take it upon myself to share in hopes that I cover more details. Jonathan was/is a great friend to us and passed away about a year ago after battling a brutal cancer at the age of 23. Dustin accompanied Jon on many countless adventures and their friendship was a special one. Whether spending time backpacking or filming their movie “The Fine Line” based off Jack Ass, the guys became as close as brothers and it was very difficult to see Jon suffer and join Jesus in March of 2011. Jon had hoped and dreamed of India. Later we learned he had desired to visit and serve others there. We desire to honor Jon’s memory and make him proud by not wasting the life we’ve been blessed with.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.” -Gandhi</p></blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>As you can see there are a ton of factors of us going to India and we will continue to share them as we prepare for this journey. We feel called to India. We are not sure what will happen or change within us once we step off the plane but we are ready for anything and can’t wait.</p>
<p>It’s difficult for me to talk about my faith. Coming from a Christian family sometimes I feel referring to the Bible and talking about my faith is a stumbling block for many on their way to finding Truth. Through my time preparing for this trip I’ve learnt that others benefit from “realness” and if you share about your faith and heart desires in a non-judgemental way others will respect that and you. Throughout this blog we will speak about our faith and our “calling” to India but we promise not to push or saturate the content to a point of disdain or confusion for those who do not share our beliefs.</p>
