				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_964" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_2185.jpg"><img class="wp-image-964" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_2185.jpg" alt="IMG_2185" width="400" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland</p></div>
<p>I realized that I never completely finished this travel series! A friend of mine mentioned it to me the other day and I logged on and realized I didn&#8217;t write about our time at The Rock n&#8217; Roll Hall of Fame.</p>
<div id="attachment_969" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-969" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1.jpg" alt="photo-1" width="400" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dustin exploring the museum</p></div>
<p>After staying the night in <a href="http://www.playhousesquare.org/" target="_blank">Playhouse Square</a> downtown Cleveland, we slept in a bit then went downstairs for a breakfast buffet. The buffet was included in our getaway package and was held at the <a href="http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/ohio/cleveland/wyndham-cleveland-at-playhousesquare/hotel-dining" target="_blank">Encore Restaurant</a>. As I mentioned earlier, <a href="http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/ohio/cleveland/wyndham-cleveland-at-playhousesquare/hotel-overview" target="_blank">The Wyndham</a> had packages that made the stay much more affordable. We purchased the Rock and Roll Package which included valet service for 24 hours, two tickets to the <a href="http://www.rockhall.com/" target="_blank">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, the room and a gourmet breakfast buffet in the morning. The total was $205 without tax. Parking would’ve been $20 minimum and tickets to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame were $25 each. The breakfast was about $13 per person. With the package, the savings made the hotel room only $109!</p>
<div id="attachment_968" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-4.jpg"><img class="wp-image-968 size-full" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-4.jpg" alt="unnamed-4" width="361" height="481" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Tribute to Michael Jackson</p></div>
<p>After a yummy breakfast which we considered to be our lunch too, we drove to the Rock n&#8217; Roll Hall of Fame. A lot of travelers will just go to where the parking is for an attraction&#8230;not us! It&#8217;s a lot cheaper to scope out the area and get cheap or free parking. To park right near the museum is $25 stinking dollars! Dustin has an application on his iPhone that showed us a parking garage close by for about $3-4. We had a short walk but not too bad.</p>
<div id="attachment_965" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-965 size-full" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed-1.jpg" alt="unnamed-1" width="361" height="481" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dustin considering wearing a Rolling Stones outfit</p></div>
<p>The museum was great! We both love music and find music history very interesting. I would&#8217;ve been disappointed for $25 per person though. Since we didn&#8217;t pay that, we enjoyed it a lot more. From Biggie Small&#8217;s t-shirt to Madonna&#8217;s cone bra, we saw it all! We spent probably 2 or 3 hours there and then were on our way home. Currently they have a Beatles exhibit that has some of the member&#8217;s pianos and the Music Festival Experience. We were excited for the music festival exhibit but weren&#8217;t very impressed. There was a movie and some artifacts from Woodstock. What I loved most was seeing clothing from artists.</p>
<p>Overall it was a spectacular get-a-way for our anniversary. I believe the Wyndham package is always going on and the <a href="http://www.clevelandart.org/" target="_blank">Cleveland Museum of Art</a> is always free.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unnamed-22.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-921 alignleft" alt="unnamed-2" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unnamed-22.jpg" width="547" height="410" /></a>Our good friend is a teacher at a local high school. She&#8217;s pretty awesome and asked us to help chaperone her field trip to Columbus. Melissa has a GIGANTIC heart for kids and she&#8217;s always planning fun things for them to do. It&#8217;s difficult to get parents and relatives to come on her trips since they are during the day.</p>
<p>In comes The Montgomery&#8217;s! Since we both work from home, it&#8217;s easier for us to change our schedule around and help out (AKA working on weekends). We helped out before Christmas and got to go to a Cleveland Cavilers game. It was tiring but really informative. To begin, we take the kids to a local college and then we take them to an <a href="http://www.fcclainc.org/" target="_blank">FCCLA</a> event at the Nationwide Arena in downtown Columbus. I hadn&#8217;t heard of FCCLA until I met Melissa. It&#8217;s basically a leadership club that promotes &#8220;personal growth and leadership development through Family and Consumer Sciences education.&#8221; Melissa was a state leader for four years and enjoys being a part of the organization.</p>
<p>The event at the <a href="http://bluejackets.nhl.com/" target="_blank">Blue Jackets</a> includes having professionals come and present to the high schoolers. They are able to ask questions and learn about college. Including in the presenters were a director of marketing, a sales person, and a chef. It was very cool to hear about jobs and also to tour the stadium. We also took the students to <a href="https://www.ohiodominican.edu/" target="_blank">Ohio Dominican University</a>, a college in Columbus and they took a tour. I was excited that we got hats that said the Blue Jackets and got to go to the game! It&#8217;s really awesome that we get to help out with things like this. You fall in love with the kids and laugh a lot.</p>

<p>Instead of buying each other a lot of chocolate or corny Valentine&#8217;s Day things, we decided to use our money to go on a little getaway. In the past we&#8217;ve gotten tattooed for the Hallmark holiday but Dustin couldn&#8217;t think of what he wanted and we needed to check out of the house (and country) for a bit. The change of scenery always refreshes and energizes me. There&#8217;s nothing like a clean hotel room and a jacuzzi tub that makes me sing out in joy! I found some amazing <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/8dd0d3f1-7169-427f-8a3a-9f9494429707" target="_blank">Groupon</a> deals and added them to a <a href="https://www.livingsocial.com/?city_id=30" target="_blank">Living Social</a> deal to make our three night vacation fall under $371 (in American currency). I get asked all the time how much our travels cost and people shake their heads when I tell them how cheap we see the world. I wanted to break down this specific trip to show a getaway doesn&#8217;t have to always cost an arm and a leg!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What I Bought To Make This Getaway Happen</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To begin, I always keep an eye out on <a href="http://www.groupon.com/getaways" target="_blank">Groupon Getaways</a> and <a href="https://www.livingsocial.com/escapes/cities/30-las-vegas" target="_blank">Living Social Escapes</a>. I also look at some other sites with deals. These sites have group deals that are easy to use and can save you hundreds and thousand of dollars. It&#8217;s important to read all of the thin print before buying&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I found a ton of Niagara Falls deals. I&#8217;m not sure why it was specifically on sale because it was March Break and packed but there were a lot of hotels on sale for this week. I worked out planning on dates and purchased three separate deals. The first one was a Living Social Deal which you had to reserve a specific date. We bought it and then booked the other two nights afterward to make sure we could stay consecutively with our deals.</p>
<div id="attachment_816" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" wp-image-816    " alt="28162164-2014-01-13-28155800-fourpoints-banner3" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/28162164-2014-01-13-28155800-fourpoints-banner3.jpg" width="425" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pool At Four Points By Sheraton Photo Credit Teambuy.ca</p></div>
<p><strong>Four Points By Sheraton Deal by Living Social</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first Living Social Deal was $125 with tax. It included the following: a one night stay at Four Points by Sheraton for two in a King room, 4 tickets to Greg Frewin&#8217;s Las Vegas Magic Show, $20 Credit at East Side Marios, 2 WEGO Shuttle Passes, 2 $50 Cards for Captain Jack&#8217;s Pirates Cove, 2 alcohol drinks at Ruth Chris&#8217;, $70 to Ruth Chris&#8217;, $20 Credit to Outback Steakhouse, and $10 to IHOP. This hotel also had free wifi throughout the hotel so Dustin could work in the room.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The deal was unbelievable. There were some stipulations that made more sense when we got there (why it was so good) but it still saved us a lot of money.  I&#8217;ll break down what it would&#8217;ve costed otherwise below. Note I only calculate the things we used.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Night Stay at the Sheraton: $118 originally for a whirlpool room which we were upgraded to.</li>
<li>4 Tickets to Greg Frewin&#8217;s Show: We only used 2 which would have been $99.17 with tax</li>
<li>$20 Credit at East Side Marios: We used this to get a large pizza for only $3 with tax. Worth $20</li>
<li>2, $50 Cards at Captain Jacks: $100 worth of arcade tokens</li>
<li>2 Alcoholic Drinks at Ruth Chris&#8217;: $22 if purchased regularly for cheaper mix drinks</li>
<li>$20 Credit to Outback: $20 Worth</li>
<li>Total Price: $379.17</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">We ended up not using all of the perks. The vouchers had a catch that you had to buy two entrees. That was kinda crazy because our meal at Outback was close to $70!!! Things were very pricey so we didn&#8217;t go to Ruth Chris&#8217; even though we had a $70 off coupon. We still got our money worth though getting $379.17 worth of things for only $125! The $125 is also Canadian so there may be some small adjustments to the price.</p>
<div id="attachment_817" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-817  " alt="download" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/download.jpeg" width="290" height="174" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Wyndham Garden Lobby Photo Credit Groupon</p></div>
<p><strong>Wyndham Garden Niagara Falls Groupon Deal</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The second we bought was from Groupon. It was $71.92 and included a one night stay for two in a Deluxe King City View Room, 2 drinks at MJ&#8217;s Lounge, Wine Tastings, $20 Credit to Outback Steakhouse, and a Chocolate FX Tour with samples. They also gave us 25% off Perkins inside the hotel which we didn&#8217;t use. We loved the new lobby and in my next post I&#8217;ll show pictures. Wifi was free throughout the hotel and was fast! The wine tickets included over $40 worth of tastings. We ended up not using all of the vouchers but still got our money worth! Here&#8217;s the breakdown of what it would&#8217;ve cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Night Stay at the Wyndham Garden: $89</li>
<li>2 Drinks at MJ&#8217;s: $10 This was great because Dustin got a beer and the bartender made me a non-alcoholic huge milkshake!</li>
<li>Wine Tastings: I actually forgot our vouchers in the room but we did enjoy a free tasting worth $14 at a local winery</li>
<li>Chocolate Factory Tour with Samples: $14 Came with 2 chocolates for us</li>
<li>Total Price: $113</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">We gave our $20 to Outback away because we didn&#8217;t want to eat there for $70+ We also didn&#8217;t get to use the ice wine tastings but did do a free one that was worth $14 (not included in the $113)</p>
<div id="attachment_818" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-818  " alt="1101286-2" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1101286-2.jpg" width="500" height="242" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Keg at Embassy Suites Photo Credit by Niagarafallsrestaurants.com</p></div>
<p><strong>Embassy Suites By Hilton Groupon Deal</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This stay was by far our favorite! The deal was great and included a lot. We spent $174.04 on this room. It included a King bed Falls View room with a Jacuzzi tub for two. It had two huge rooms but we only used one. The view was really worth it as you could see the entire falls from the 27th floor. With the Groupon came: $30 toward The Keg, Admission for four to Cannon Blasters and Time Crunch at an arcade, 4 IMAX movie tickets, 2, $50 game play cards, managers reception with 2 alcoholic drinks and snacks, full made-to-order breakfast.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We used everything but the 2 extra IMAX tickets and Cannon Blasters and Time Crunch which we ran out of time for (pun intended). Here&#8217;s the price breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Whirlpool Suite Room with Fallsview: $175</li>
<li>$30 towards The Keg: We ate here and it was amazing and delicious. It was about $70 without taking the discount off. With tip it was $60 for two entrees and an appetizer</li>
<li>2, $50 arcade cards: $100</li>
<li>4 IMAX Tickets: $72 This was great because we were able to give two away to a couple with kids. I&#8217;ll only put 1/2 though since we used half. This also included 1/2 off the Daredevils Exhibit so it saved us $8</li>
<li>Breakfast: $25  it was lunch for us</li>
<li>Managers Reception: $15 2 great drinks and snacks</li>
<li>Total: $389</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">So in conclusion, we paid a total of $370.96 for the basics of the vacation but got $881.17 worth of things! That&#8217;s a huge saving!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is the best travel laptop? Unfortunately there is no cut and dry answer to this question. Each person has different needs and will be traveling to different places. This was the most difficult travel purchase for me by far. When you spend as much time in front of the computer as I do, a good laptop is going to make a big difference.</p>
<p>I went through just about every option I could find, multiple times. Do I go with the newly created category of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrabook">ultrabooks</a>, or just get a small netbook? Maybe even a tablet? I eventually decided it was time to make a list of some travel laptop contenders.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The Macbook Air 2010 was an option to take over Tiffany&#8217;s laptop and have her use and iPad. She has since found out that the iPad is not a laptop replacement for her.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, I did not end up choosing any of these options and went with the highly raved about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005AJYZE8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005AJYZE8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=reroujourn-20" target="_blank">Lenovo ThinkPad x220</a>. This thing is an absolute beast. Lenovo&#8217;s ThinkPad line has a reputation for being durable and reliable. Many business use them and many Linux users recommend them. Now I do too. Take a look past the ascetics of ThinkPad line, and look at the quality. A reliable laptop is worth a lot when you are traveling.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I held onto my blanket in the car as Dustin drove to Grady Memorial Hospital. I was sweating and having a hard time concentrating on the road. In less than an hour I would have a foot long needle inserted into my spine for a lumbar puncture to determine what was causing my debilitating headaches.</p>
<p>It was terrifying. For someone who hated needles I could only imagine the feeling of having one jammed into my spinal column and drawing out spinal fluid.</p>
<p>Although the procedure went well and the pain was minimal, there was great discomfort. After numbing the area the needle was inserted and I could feel when the syringe hit a nerve because my leg involuntarily jerked. The total time took about an hour and recovery was two. The nurses were amazing and I was excited to hear that caffeine was highly suggested to help with the post spinal tap headache (Dustin went and got me Starbucks).</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">A Turn For the Worst</h1>
<p>Being wheeled out in a wheelchair felt strange and on the way home I was relieved to have the lumbar puncture completed. I enjoyed watching Netflix with Dustin but around bedtime I began to feel terrible pain all over my body. In the morning I awoke vomiting and in so much pain. After numerous calls to my neurologist and different anti-nausea pills, the doctor put me on a medication used for chemo patients to keep from vomiting.</p>
<p>The pain didn’t stop.</p>
<p>I was in the worst pain of my life and it was all I could do to breathe without sharp pain. We went to the Emergency Room where I was treated with medicine and fluids then sent home. After resting without pain and eating a little something the pain re-occurred only worse. I couldn’t even keep water down. We had no choice but to go back to the ER where they gave me anti-nausea intravenously. I was so dehydrated it took about ten tries to begin the IV. Since the IV hadn’t been started I was also given large shots in both arms. That night we didn’t get home until about 3 in the morning. Hoping we were finally out of the clear, I layed in bed and fell asleep until I awoke nauseous again in the morning.</p>
<p>I rang my dad, sobbing. I felt hopeless. I wasn’t sick enough to be admitted to the hospital but sick enough that I couldn’t stay home without extreme pain.</p>
<p>We had no choice but to go to the ER again. This time I screamed and sobbed as Dustin sped to Med Central. The pain was so bad I felt like passing out. After numerous tests they determined my Gastritis was causing the pain and gave me medications and a GI cocktail (for the stomach lining). The doctor ordered a CAT scan and X-rays. Nothing was found regarding my stomach other than Gastritis which eats away at the lining of one’s stomach. This can be caused by stress and certain foods. Gastritis is also hereditary and my dad has it.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Healing</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">My grandparents and mother came to the hospital to pick me up and bring me home. For the next few days I couldn’t get up or move much. I layed on the couch and watched the Olympics and dreamt of being able to go out on errands and simply feel “normal”. Dustin and I went to Delaware, Ohio (an hour and a half away from my mothers) for doctor’s appointments and I was finally given medication to help with my stomach. I couldn’t eat for over a week and dropped between 15-20 pounds. None of my clothing fit and I was exhausted all the time. My grandmother read a verse over me that declared God’s healing.</p>
<p>While sitting in a bubble bath I talked to Dustin and begged for a vacation. Could we get away from all of this? We were living with our parents and didn’t have a ton of space to just be together. He agreed that I could look for a vacation while sick and we could go on one when I felt well enough. Looking online at vacation packaged kept my spirits up even though I couldn’t manage to eat a full meal.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My neurologist found nothing wrong with my spinal fluid and pressure. It appeared that the headaches could be caused by a vision problem or anxiety. After going to a opthamologist to get my eyes checked we determined that being off the anxiety medicine could be causing the headaches.</p>
<p>We hopped hotels for a week to give us privacy while I attempted to recover from the recurring panic attacks. Finally after meeting with a smart psychiatrist I slowly began to feel myself and we decided to place our trip to India on hold. By settling down close to family and my doctors I could focus on feeling better. Were we being attacked by the enemy because we were doing God&#8217;s work and following His call? Perhaps. Were we still going to hold close to the calling placed on our lives? Yes.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Currently</h1>
<p>Emotionally and physically I had been through Hell. Even Dustin had physical signs of extreme stress (found by the Dentist) and we were in need of a refuge. We prayed to Jesus for help and before long we were looking for an apartment and were able to use some money to supply <a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/top-ten-las-vegas/">a getaway to Las Vegas</a> full of rest and relaxation.</p>
<p>Currently we are living in a home in Lexington, Ohio and preparing for a season of rest and recovery. Dustin is working as a freelancer and I am working on my first book. When I’m not writing for the blog or my book I am baking, creating things, and reading. We miss our old church, <a href="http://www.sanctuarycolumbus.com/" target="_blank">Sanctuary</a> but plan on attending <a href="http://www.sanctuarycolumbus.com/" target="_blank">Mosaic</a> led by <a href="http://tonypingitoreblog.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Tony Pingitore</a>, an old friend/mentor of ours.</p>
<p>We’re sad about not being in India but know God wants us here for now. He continues to reroute our journey but we’re so happy to have Him directing it. We’d have it no other way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignright  wp-image-590" title="mail box" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/mail-box.jpg" alt="mail box" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/mail-box.jpg 500w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/mail-box-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />Since leaving college I’ve found myself perpetually broke. “Broke” not in the sense that I can’t afford ramen noodles, but “broke” in the sense that I can’t go out sometimes, order indulgent magazine subscriptions and afford <a href="http://www.meltingpot.com/" target="_blank">The Melting Pot</a> or The Signature Lounge on the 96th floor of the John Hancock building in Chicago.</p>
<p>To be honest, since being married we’ve both been successfully employed and have made enough money to live pretty well but the occasional indulgence can throw our budget off or leave us feeling guilty because we love social justice and the poor. Whenever I want to buy the latest eyeliner or go out to the hippest lounge in Chi-town Dustin’s always squirming and adding that we can hit up alternatives and save cash for our travels. He’s right.</p>
<p>It’s hard to justify spending $50 a year on Whole Living Magazine or Vogue when there are homeless people sleeping on the “L” on our way to work. It’s even harder to hand over $100 for a night out at The Melting Pot (a really cool fondue restaurant) or $40 for cocktails at a new lounge when there are millions of children being enslaved due to Human Trafficking.</p>
<h2><img class="alignleft  wp-image-591" title="make up" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/make-up.jpg" alt="make up" width="360" height="270" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/make-up.jpg 600w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/make-up-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" />Insert Free Things Here</h2>
<p>I read about getting free things online while Googling it. Someone I knew had mentioned that she got free samples on a popular blog and I was in awe. Free? Free shipping and free items that I could use? Things like DVD’s, American Apparel clothes, perfume, magazine subscriptions, over the counter medicines I use all the time like Advil and Tylenol, and purses could be free? I thought there had to be a catch. Perhaps you had to blog about the brands (I didn’t have time for a blog) or maybe you had to pay shipping costs and call and cancel subscriptions all the time? Nope. The article assured there were no catches. So I made a list of websites that gave away free stuff and began signing up.</p>
<p>By golly it worked! Before I knew it I was receiving samples and gifts in the mail. I acquired free coupons for makeup and medicine&#8230;I even got clothing. There are enough subscriptions to Food and Wine, Caribbean Travel, and Photography Magazine to fill six doctors’ offices. I didn’t believe it at first and always checked to make sure I didn’t have to cancel subscriptions or was charged on my debit card (I didn’t and I wasn’t.) Two years later I still check out the websites that post free things and receive books, food samples, and free event tickets.</p>
<h2>Favorite Freebies To Date<a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/magazines.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-589" title="magazines" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/magazines.jpg" alt="magazines" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/magazines.jpg 500w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/magazines-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></h2>

<p>Ok, so I get that you get free stuff and it&#8217;s awesome but how can I?</p>
<p><strong>Free Stuff Websites</strong><br />
The two websites that I have found and can refer you to without a shadow of a doubt that you’ll receive free things (and not be charged) are <a href="http://freestufftimes.com/" target="_blank">Freestufftimes.com</a> and <a href="http://www.heyitsfree.net/" target="_blank">Heyitsfree.net</a>. These two websites are where I’ve gotten most of my free items from. Once you go to the websites simply look for the free items that interest you (This may/may not be all of them!). Follow the directions offered by the website and wait to see your free stuff in the mail. Remember that some items are time sensitive and only give certain amounts of samples out. The website will tell you. If you are unsure if the offer is expired you can simply click on the comments section under the offer and see what others are saying. Another great aspect of Freestufftimes.com is the “What I Got” section which lists and provides pictures of things other users received.</p>
<p><strong>Target &amp; Walmart Samples</strong></p>
<p>You can periodically check Target and Walmart’s websites to find offers for free samples often. I’ve received many great samples from each. Sam’s Club and Costco also offer free samples for members online. I’m not a member thus haven’t tried any.</p>
<p><strong>Coupons</strong></p>
<p>In addition to free items you can look up free coupons from tons of blogs and websites. Begin getting coupons by checking out <a href="http://www.freecoupons.com/" target="_blank">Freecoupons.com</a>. Coupons are also offered on both free stuff websites (freestufftimes.com and heyitsfree.net) which can help you grab those $10 pistachios we both know you want.</p>
<h2>Tips For Getting Free Things<img class="alignright  wp-image-592" title="meal" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/meal.jpg" alt="meal" width="420" height="315" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/meal.jpg 600w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/meal-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /></h2>
<p>1. Always make sure it’s free. Even though you can sign up with confidence on both websites I mentioned you should always double check and make sure the offer is still valid.</p>
<p>2. Open a “spam” email account to receive newsletters and confirmation emails. On many “free” offers they will want you to offer up an email or receive a newsletter in exchange for a free item. Fear not! Simply open a new email account for spam. You can also use “fake” email accounts by through <a href="http://www.fakemailgenerator.com/" target="_blank">Fake Mail Generator</a>. These fake email accounts will allow you enough time to confirm an email then close them. (Dustin and I do this all the time!)</p>
<p>3. It doesn’t hurt to “like” things on Facebook. Get the free item then “unlike.” If you do love their services or item stay “liking” them.</p>
<p>4. Use autofill on your computer. This program that is built into most browsers saves your information and fills it in automatically for you. This way you don’t have to fill out a ton of information to get free items.</p>
<p>5. Recycle junk. By signing up to get free things you inadvertently get mail (such as newsletters, updates, etc). Try your hardest to recycle.</p>
<p>6. Thank organizations. If you receive something in the mail that you love, thank the organization. This small act of gratefulness keeps them giving out free stuff.</p>
<p>Enjoy getting free things in your mailbox!</p>

<p>It began in middle school, really. I remember looking around the home class and staring at every other girls’ hair, outfit, and painted faces. Comparing myself to the countless <a href="http://www.painetworks.com/photos/gu/gu2181.JPG" target="_blank">blue-shadowed adversaries</a> I found I was lacking in everything. How could I grab Andrew’s attention, (the top basketball/football player with gorgeous blue eyes and witty humor) without spending hours straightening, plucking, purchasing, and investing in my looks? Why didn’t my hair straighten like Susans? Couldn’t I stop biting my nails like Karen? What about Carrie’s nice clothes from Aéropostale? I had to own an American Eagle pair of clogs or else I’d just die (as I explained with passion to my mother).</p>
<p>After many years of struggling with self-worth and finding pride in my appearance, I’ve learned to love myself. I’m not happy dressing and looking like every other girl. I love myself now with grace, love, and a lot of empathy. I wear what I want and enjoy artistic expression through the way I dress and do my hair and makeup. I take pride in my body modifications and enjoy challenging the status quo. Can a “good” person have tattoos? You bet. Can a “Christian” woman take great care of herself and look beautiful? Of course.</p>

<h2>Who I Am Now</h2>
<p>Now, ten years later I’ve grown and have become what I never wanted to be: myself. Tiffany. I have beautiful blue eyes that change shades depending on my emotions, my hair is uncontrollably curly but has learned to love me back with a little care and attention. My nails grow strong and love the color blue on them, my lips are full and I can easily pull off full bodied dresses and skirts with my womanly hips. I also have acne scarring that reminds me of the countless trips to the dermatologist, some stretch marks that I’d rather not flaunt, and some extra pounds in the midsection. Overall, I see myself as my best friend. A girl that’s lived a long, hard but blessed life that will be there for you in an instant and can emphasize with conviction most life issues.</p>
<h2>My Hair</h2>
<p>So this brings me to my hair. I adore my hair. My hair is a way for me to hide some scarring on my right temple from acne and also helps to distract from my chubbier chin (or so I think in my mind). My hair has become a love of mine and I take care of it like a mother. I invest in great haircuts and spend a lot of time conditioning it and using organic products. I’ve spent many years perfecting the art of my locks and I beam when anyone compliments me on them, especially Dustin. When I am feeling fat or rather ugly I always combat these thoughts by assuring myself; at least I have pretty hair. I tie my identity as a woman to my long curls and cannot even comprehend myself with short hair.</p>
<div id="attachment_535" style="width: 198px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-535  " title="long hair picture" src="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/6140_158471948288_678288288_3438270_3464413_n-188x300.jpg" alt="Tiffany's Long Hair" width="188" height="300" srcset="https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/6140_158471948288_678288288_3438270_3464413_n-188x300.jpg 188w, https://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/6140_158471948288_678288288_3438270_3464413_n.jpeg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Curly Hair Porn</p></div>
<p>This is why I am cutting my hair off for India.</p>
<p>In some way, whether intentionally or unaware I’ve placed a lot of my self-worth into my hair. How? I’m not sure but I know that our process of traveling and serving in India is an act of selflessness and I want to transform my posture to one of humility. In some ways I will be free and forced to live face forward, without hiding behind long hair or a styled look.</p>
<p>So, will I cry when the big chop comes? Probably. Will I hold the ponytail and rub it against my face and keep it by my bed for months? Creepy&#8230; No.</p>
<p>I’m donating my hair to <a href="http://www.locksoflove.org/" target="_blank">Locks of Love</a>, an awesome organization that uses donated hair to make wigs for economically disadvantaged children that have long term illnesses that results in hair loss. If you haven’t heard of the organization, where the heck have you been? It’s a great organization that’s been around for years. You can stay tuned for the big day that has yet to be determined. If you can’t wait until then have fun looking at <a href="http://reroutedjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/196_506702282992_59102828_30672536_5360_n.jpeg" target="_blank">this photo</a> of when Dustin and his good friend Brice shaved their heads to donate to Locks of Love a few years back. P.S. Dustin’s bare head does indeed look like the moon. Hence, he won’t be shaving his head for India.</p>
<p>Until then, I’m enjoying my long locks and intentionally leaving the windows down for some wind-blown attractiveness.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi friends. A HUGE request that would really help us here at ReroutedJourney.com.</p>
<p>I have been writing about my travel experiences since I was old enough to hold a compass. There is an <strong>amazing opportunity</strong> to get my writing recognized and win us a trip to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD</span></strong> for 4 people (including airfare). Intrepid travel is holding a competition for those who consider themselves intrepid travelers. (intrepid means fearless) I have submitted a written story of my time serving in Africa.</p>
<p>Dustin and I are almost obsessive with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Stroud" target="_blank">The One and Only Les Stroud</a> who happens to be one of the judges. Les tackles the outdoors like nobody&#8217;s business but our favorite aspect of his travel is a series called Beyond Survival that encourages the protection of dying people groups around the world. (I could go on and on about how amazing and culturally competent he is &#8230;) Other judges include Charley Boorman, Pauline Frommer, and and Felicity Harley. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If my entry is in the top ten it will be reviewed by these amazing travelers. </span></strong> Since this is based on VOTES. It&#8217;s up to you to help me win. Please take a few minutes out of your day and vote for my entry. (You can only vote once so you&#8217;re off the hook about voting again and again or at a specific time)</p>
<h2><a href="http://iamintrepid.intrepidtravel.com/entries/show/id/703" target="_blank">You can vote for and read my entry here! </a></h2>
<p>If I&#8217;m blessed to win, Dustin and I plan on using the opportunity to visit the states and come home for Christmas once while traveling in India or to continue to travel and serve.</p>
