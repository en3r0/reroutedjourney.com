		<description><![CDATA[Marla, we miss you guys so much! It&#039;s been difficult being so far away from CG but we know we&#039;re where we need to be. Words can&#039;t express how much we appreciate the prayers and support. We&#039;re praying for you and Gabe daily also. Keep strong! -T]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We love you guys. And we pray for you every single day. We can relate to what you&#039;re going through on so many levels (which you know), and we&#039;re asking God to heal you fully--physically and emotionally and to continue to move you into his perfect plan for your lives, re-re-routed journey and all. xoxoxoxo!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well done!
Instead of pushing through you are waiting on God and his timing. Never let pride get in the way....which you wisely have not! 

God&#039;s ways are not our ways. Just know when the time is right you will go! And God will go before you.

There is nothing better than being in the center of Gods will and plan. 

Be anxious about nothing but in prayer and supplication present your requests to God.

I love your openness to share. God can really only use the pots that have cracks in them...those are the ones that let his glory shine through! 

Press on my friends :)]]></description>
