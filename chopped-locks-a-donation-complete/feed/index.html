		<description><![CDATA[Yay! Short hair is &quot;in&quot;. Or at least now it is that I&#039;m rocking it. It was a difficult thing to do but I was very brave (I&#039;m learning to be brave in general the last few months). The hairstyle is best because Dustin and I were both getting sick of washing my hair. In the end I donated a foot of hair! We hope to be at church on Sunday if all is well. We can visit then! Love you. -T]]></description>
